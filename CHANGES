This file documents the changes from version 2.1 of S.el (also known
as gnuemacs3 on Statlib) and the current version.

For current users of S-mode, here are some of the incompatible
changes and features new to version 3.3 of S-mode:

   * Command-line completion of object names, and faster completion in
     other situations.

   * `Hot Keys' for the commonly-used functions `objects()',
     `search()' and `attach()' and a facility to add your own hot keys
     with keyboard macros.

   * Simultaneous multiple function editing, with integrated
     error-checking and parsing. Mnemonic names for edit buffers.

   * Debugging features: facility for stepping through S code and
     evaluating portions of code with the output appearing as if the
     commands has been typed in manually.

   * S can now be run from a different directory each session.

   * A dedicated mode for viewing S help files. Individual help
     buffers are maintained for quick repeated access. Completion for
     help files without a corresponding object.

   * Facility for maintaining organised backups of S source code.

   * Indenting and formatting commands for editing S source code.

   * Special handling of the S graphics facilities, including an
     experimental Tek graphics mode.

   * Better handling of temporary files and buffers.


   * Some keybindings have changed to conform to GNU guidelines.

Here are the changes to the keybindings from version 2.1:

INFERIOR-S-MODE:

C-c h    S-display-help-on-object    MOVED TO	   C-c C-h         [*]
C-c d    S-dump-object-into-scratch  MOVED TO	   C-c C-d	   [*]
C-c l    S-load-file		     MOVED TO	   C-c C-l	   [*]
C-c C-o  comint-kill-output          REDEFINED AS  S-kill-output
C-c C-z	 comint-stop-subjob	     REDEFINED AS  S-abort

S-MODE:

C-c h    S-display-help-on-object    MOVED TO	   C-c C-h	   [*]
C-c l    S-load-file		     MOVED TO	   C-c C-l	   [*]
C-c z    switch-to-S		     MOVED TO	   C-c C-y	   [*]
C-c C-k  S-eval-line-and-go          MOVED TO	   C-c M-j	   [*]
C-c k	 S-eval-line		     MOVED TO	   C-c C-j	   [*]
C-c C-e  S-eval-function-and-go      MOVED TO	   C-c M-f
				     REDEFINED AS  S-execute-in-tb
C-c e    S-eval-function	     MOVED TO	   C-c C-f	   [*]
C-c C-b	 S-eval-buffer-and-go	     MOVED TO	   C-c M-b	   
C-c b	 S-eval-buffer		     MOVED TO	   C-c C-b	   [*]
C-c C-r	 S-eval-region-and-go	     MOVED TO	   C-c M-r
C-c r	 S-eval-region		     MOVED TO	   C-c C-r	   [*]

If your fingers insist on using the old bindings, place the following
piece of code in your .emacs to emulate the bindings marked [*] above:

(setq S-mode-load-hook
      '(lambda nil
	 (define-key inferior-S-mode-map "\C-ch" 'S-display-help-on-object)
	 (define-key inferior-S-mode-map "\C-cl" 'S-load-file)
	 (define-key inferior-S-mode-map "\C-cd" 'S-dump-object-into-edit-buffer)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-ch" 'S-display-help-on-object)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-cl" 'S-load-file)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-cz" 'S-switch-to-S)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-c\C-k" 'S-eval-line-and-go)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-ck" 'S-eval-line)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-ce" 'S-eval-function)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-cb" 'S-eval-buffer)
	 (define-key S-mode-map "\C-cr" 'S-eval-region)))

However, I do encourage you to become familiar with the new bindings.


   * General code cleanups and optimizations.

In particular, a number of variable and function names have been
changed. You may need to modify any hooks you used in version 2.1. The
changes are:

Before version 3.3		Version 3.3
------------------		-----------
explicit-Splus-args		inferior-Splus-args
make-S-comint			inferior-S-make-comint
S-send-input			inferior-S-send-input

wait-for-S-prompt		inferior-S-wait-for-prompt
S-dump-object-into-scratch	S-dump-object-into-edit-buffer
find-S-object-default		S-read-object-name-default
find-S-object			S-read-object-name
get-S-search-list		S-get-search-list
get-S-object-list-r		S-get-object-list-r
get-S-object-list		S-get-object-list
command-to-S			S-command
beginning-of-S-function		S-beginning-of-function
end-of-S-function		S-end-of-function
extract-word-name		S-extract-word-name
switch-to-S			S-switch-to-S
switch-to-end-of-S		S-switch-to-end-of-S

default-S-style			S-default-style

(some of these symbols were not present in version 2.1 of S.el, but
have been used in `private' releases since 2.1)

In addition, many of the internal functions have been modified in
implementation and/or usage. See S.el for more information.
