To use this command, first start a process on a remote computer by
manual use of telnet, rlogin, ssh, or some other protocol.  Start the
relevant program (\"S\" or \"R\" or \"sas -stdio\") in that buffer.  Once
you are talking to S or R or SAS, then execute `ess-remote' to make
the current buffer an inferior-ess buffer with the right behavior for
the language you are currently working with.  With S and R, use C-c
C-n to send lines over.  With SAS, use C-c i
`ess-eval-line-and-step-invisibly' to send lines over invisibly.
