;;; Commentary:

;; Code-dependent highlighting
;;  *****
;;
;;  Adding highlighting to noweb-mode.el
;;
;;  Here is a description of how one can add highlighting via the
;;  font-lock package to noweb buffers.  It uses the hooks provided by
;;  noweb-mode.el.  The solution provides the following features:
;;  1) The documentation chunks are highlighted in the noweb-doc-mode
;;  (e.g., LaTeX).
;;  2) The code chunks without mode comments (-*- mode -*-) are
;;  highlighted in the noweb-code-mode.
;;  3) The code chunks with mode comments (-*- mode -*-) on the first
;;  line of the first chunk with this name are highlighted in the mode
;;  in the comment.
;;
;;  For example, given the file:
;;
;;    % -*- mode: Noweb; noweb-code-mode: c-mode -*-
;;
;;    \begin{itemize}
;;    \item a main routine written in C,
;;    \item a log configuration file parser written in YACC, and
;;    \item a lexical analyzer written in Lex.
;;    \end{itemize}
;;
;;    <<warning c comment>>=
;;    /* DO NOT EDIT ME! */
;;    /* This file was automatically generated from %W% (%G%). */
;;    @
;;
;;    <<warning nroff comment>>=
;;    .\" -*- nroff -*-
;;    .\" DO NOT EDIT ME!
;;    .\" This file was automatically generated from %W% (%G%).
;;    @
;;
;;  The LaTeX list is highlighted in latex-mode (the default noweb doc
;;  mode), the chunk <<warning c comment>> is highlighted in c-mode (the
;;  default noweb code mode), and the chunk <<warning nroff comment>> is
;;  highlighted in nroff-mode due to the "-*- nroff -*-" comment.
;;
;;  Chunks are highlighted each time point moves into them from a
;;  different mode. They are also fontified 'on the fly', but this is
;;  less reliable, since the syntax can depend on the context. It's as
;;  good as you would get outside noweb-mode, though.
;;
;;  To use it, you must add
;;  (require 'noweb-font-lock-mode) to your .emacs file.
;;  Then, if you use either global-font-lock or turn-on-font-lock
;;  statements, any noweb-mode buffers will be fontified
;;  appropriately. (We have to redefine turn-on-font-lock, but it
;;  saves breaking other packages (in particular ESS, which I use a
;;  lot), that assume that turn-on-font-lock is the way to turn on
;;  font locking.

;;  Alternatively, you can turn noweb-font-lock-mode on and off by
;;  using M-x noweb-font-lock-mode. However, turning
;;  noweb-font-lock-mode off when global-font-lock-mode is t makes it
;;  impossible to use font-locking in that buffer subsequently, other
;;  than by turning noweb-font-lock-mode back on.

;;  2) The highlighting sometimes get confused, but this is no longer
;;  a noweb problem. Highlighting should work as well within a chunk
;;  as it does without noweb-mode.
;;  There are some problems with, for example latex-mode: a `$' in a
;;  verbatim environment with throw the font-locking out.
;;  One slight blemish is that code-quotes are highlighted as comments
;;  as they are being entered. They are only highlighted correctly
;;  after `noweb-font-lock-fontify-chunk' has been run, either as a
;;  command or through changing to a different chunk and back again
;;  (unless they lie on a single line, in which case they are
;;  fontified correctly once they are completed).

;;; Code:

(require 'noweb-mode)
(require 'font-lock)

(defvar noweb-font-lock-mode nil
  "Buffer local variable, t iff this buffer is using noweb-font-lock-mode.")

(defvar noweb-use-font-lock-mode t
  "DO NOT CHANGE THIS VARIABLE

;; methods; XEmacs 20.4 doesn't define this, sigh...  -- KLUDGE --.

(defvar noweb-font-lock-doc-start-face font-lock-reference-face
  "Face to use to highlight the `@' at the start of each doc chunk")

(defvar noweb-font-lock-brackets-face font-lock-reference-face

;; fontifies the entire buffer in the new major mode every time you
