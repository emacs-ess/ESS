 ; Requires and autoloads

;;; AJR: THIS IS GROSS AND DISGUSTING (but I wrote it).
;;; MM:  and I had to add all other 'ess-eval-*** ...
;;; >>> why not just do the obvious instead of all these ? Namely,
;;; (require 'ess-inf)
;;; ------------------ ?
;;; AJR: The reason is that we ONLY need to load ess-inf for the
;;; functions which are interactive in nature.   We don't want to load
;;; it when we are only editing.

;;; VS: ess-inf is always loaded form ess-toggle-underscore in ess-s-l.el. I am
;;; placing require ess-inf and ess-mode in ess. This cross autoloads are
;;; useless. Compiler is also silent without them. These funcs are used in mode-map
;;; only as symbols.

\\{ess-mode-map}

Extra binding to note:  'ESC C-\\' indent-region.

Entry to this mode runs the hooks in ess-mode-hook.

You can send text to the inferior ESS process from other buffers containing
ESS source.
    `ess-eval-region' sends the current region to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-buffer' sends the current buffer to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-function' sends the current function to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-line' sends the current line to the ESS process.
    `ess-beginning-of-function' and `ess-end-of-function' move the point to
        the beginning and end of the current ESS function.
    `ess-switch-to-ESS' switches the current buffer to the ESS process buffer.
    `ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS' switches the current buffer to the ESS process
        buffer and puts point at the end of it.

    `ess-eval-region-and-go', `ess-eval-buffer-and-go',
        `ess-eval-function-and-go', and `ess-eval-line-and-go' switch to the S
        process buffer after sending their text.

    `ess-load-file' sources a file of commands to the ESS process.

\\[ess-indent-command] indents for ESS code.
\\[backward-delete-char-untabify] converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Comments are indented in a similar way to Emacs-lisp mode:
       `###'     beginning of line
       `##'      the same level of indentation as the code
       `#'       the same column on the right, or to the right of such a
                 column if that is not possible.(default value 40).
                 \\[indent-for-comment] command automatically inserts such a
                 `#' in the right place, or aligns such a comment if it is
                 already inserted.
\\[ess-indent-exp] command indents each line of the ESS grouping following point.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `ess-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in ESS mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `ess-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces inserted in S
    code.
 `ess-indent-level'
    Indentation of ESS statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation of the line on
    which the open-brace appears.
 `ess-continued-statement-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a substatement, such as the then-clause of an
    if or body of a while.
 `ess-continued-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation given to a brace that starts a substatement.
    This is in addition to ess-continued-statement-offset.
 `ess-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with an open brace.
 `ess-arg-function-offset'
    Extra indent for internal substatements of function `foo' that called
    in `arg=foo(...)' form.
   If not number, the statements are indented at open-parenthesis following
   `foo'.
 `ess-arg-function-offset-new-line'
   Extra indent for function arguments when ( is folowed by new line.
 `ess-expression-offset'
    Extra indent for internal substatements of `expression' that specified
    in `obj <- expression(...)' form.
    If not number, the statements are indented at open-parenthesis following
    `expression'.
 `ess-brace-imaginary-offset'
    An open brace following other text is treated as if it were
    this far to the right of the start of its line.
 `ess-else-offset'
    Extra indentation for line if it starts with `else'.
 `ess-close-brace-offset'
    Extra indentation for closing braces.
 `ess-fancy-comments'
    Non-nil means distinguish between #, ##, and ### for indentation.

Furthermore, \\[ess-set-style] command enables you to set up predefined ess-mode
indentation style. At present, predefined style are `BSD', `GNU', `K&R', `C++',
`CLB' (quoted from C language style)."
