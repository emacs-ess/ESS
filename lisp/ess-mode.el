\\{ess-mode-map}

Extra binding to note:  'ESC C-\\' indent-region.

Entry to this mode runs the hooks in ess-mode-hook.

You can send text to the inferior ESS process from other buffers containing
ESS source.
    `ess-eval-region' sends the current region to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-buffer' sends the current buffer to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-function' sends the current function to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-line' sends the current line to the ESS process.
    `ess-beginning-of-function' and `ess-end-of-function' move the point to
        the beginning and end of the current ESS function.
    `ess-switch-to-ESS' switches the current buffer to the ESS process buffer.
    `ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS' switches the current buffer to the ESS process
        buffer and puts point at the end of it.

    `ess-eval-region-and-go', `ess-eval-buffer-and-go',
        `ess-eval-function-and-go', and `ess-eval-line-and-go' switch to the S
        process buffer after sending their text.

    `ess-load-file' sources a file of commands to the ESS process.

\\[ess-indent-command] indents for ESS code.
\\[backward-delete-char-untabify] converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
Comments are indented in a similar way to Emacs-lisp mode:
       `###'     beginning of line
       `##'      the same level of indentation as the code
       `#'       the same column on the right, or to the right of such a
                 column if that is not possible.(default value 40).
                 \\[indent-for-comment] command automatically inserts such a
                 `#' in the right place, or aligns such a comment if it is
                 already inserted.
\\[ess-indent-exp] command indents each line of the ESS grouping following point.

Variables controlling indentation style:
 `ess-tab-always-indent'
    Non-nil means TAB in ESS mode should always reindent the current line,
    regardless of where in the line point is when the TAB command is used.
 `ess-auto-newline'
    Non-nil means automatically newline before and after braces inserted in S
    code.
 `ess-indent-offset'
    Indentation of ESS statements within surrounding block.
    The surrounding block's indentation is the indentation of the line on
    which the open-brace appears.
 `ess-offset-block'
    Indentation of blocks opened with curly braces or anonymous parentheses.
 `ess-offset-arguments'
    Indentation of function arguments or bracket indices.
 `ess-offset-arguments-newline'
    Indentation of function arguments or bracket indices when the opening
    delimiter is immediately followed by a newline.
 `ess-offset-continued'
    Indentation style for continued statements.
 `ess-align-nested-calls'
    Functions whose nested calls should be aligned.
 `ess-align-arguments-in-calls'
    Calls in which arguments should be aligned.
 `ess-align-continuations-in-calls'
    Whether ignore indentation after an operator in calls
 `ess-align-blocks'
    Blocks that should always be aligned vertically.
 `ess-indent-from-lhs'
    Whether function calls given as argument should be indented from the
    parameter name.
 `ess-indent-from-chain-start'
    Whether to indent arguments from the first of several consecutive calls.
 `ess-indent-with-fancy-comments'
    Non-nil means distinguish between #, ##, and ### for indentation.

Furthermore, \\[ess-set-style] command enables you to set up predefined ess-mode
indentation style. At present, predefined style are `BSD', `GNU', `K&R', `C++',
`CLB' (quoted from C language style)."
