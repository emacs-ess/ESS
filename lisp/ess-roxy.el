;;; Commentary:

;; Lots of inspiration from doc-mode,
;; http://nschum.de/src/emacs/doc-mode/
;;
;; Features::
;;
;; - basic highlighting
;; - generating and updating templates from function definition and customized default template
;;   - C-c C-e C-o :: update template
;; - navigating and filling roxygen fields
;;   - C-c TAB, M-q, C-a, ENTER, M-h :: advised tag completion, fill-paragraph,
;;        move-beginning-of-line, newline-and-indent, mark-paragraph
;;   - C-c C-e n,p :: next, previous roxygen entry
;;   - C-c C-e C-c :: Unroxygen region. Convenient for editing examples.
;; - folding visibility using hs-minor-mode
;;   - TAB :: advised ess-ident-command, hide entry if in roxygen doc.
;; - preview
;;   - C-c C-e C-r :: create a preview of the Rd file as generated
;;     using roxygen
;;   - C-c C-e C-t :: create a preview of the Rd HTML file as generated
;;     using roxygen and the tools package
;;   - C-c C-e t :: create a preview of the Rd text file
;;
;; Known issues:
;;
;; - hideshow mode does not work very well. In particular, if ordinary
;;   comments precede a roxygen entry, then both will be hidden in the
;;   same overlay from start and not unfoldable using TAB since the
;;   roxygen prefix is not present. The planned solution is implement
;;   a replacement for hideshow.
;; - only limited functionality for S4 documentation.

;; this *is* enabled now via ess-mode-hook in ./ess-site.el
