;;; Commentary:

;; Although installing ESS is relatively simple, sometimes people get
;; confused as to what to add to their init files, or even where their
;; init files are located.  The following procedure should be a bit
;; simpler, as Emacs will add the necessary start-up lines itself.
;; (The instructions below assume you have downloaded ess as a zip
;; package, but it will work also for the .tar.gz version of ESS as
;; long as you know how to unpack a .tar.gz in step 3.)
;;
;; Installing ESS for the first time.
;;
;; 1. Create a folder (e.g C:/emacs) where you will store ESS.  We will
;;   assume that you are installing ESS into C:/emacs (unix users can use
;;   ~/emacs).
;;
;; 2. Download ess-5.2.12.zip and store it in the folder you created.
;;
;; 3. Unpack the files from the zip archive, e.g. by right-clicking on it
;;    within Windows explorer and selecting "Extract all".  On unix, use
;;    "unzip ess-5.2.12.zip".
;;
;; 4. Start a new emacs (or xemacs).
;;
;; 5. In the new emacs, you need to open the file "ess-install.el" which
;;    is part of ESS.  To do this, type:
;;
;;    C-x C-f c:/emacs/ess-5.2.12/lisp/ess-install.el RET
;;
;; You should now see a lisp file with the top line:
;;   ;;; ess-install.el --- Automatic installation of ESS.
;;
;; 6. Type M-x eval-buffer RET
;;
;; What does this do?  This will find your emacs initialisation file, and
;; it will add the following two lines to the end of the file:
;;
;;   ;;; ESS setup for version 5.2.12
;;   (load "c:/emacs/ess-5.2.12/lisp/ess-site")
;;
;; Do not edit those two lines!  They are useful if later you come to
;; upgrade ESS.
;;
;; 7. Start a new Emacs and you should find then that ESS is loaded.  For
;;    example, create a new file called "foo.R" and check that it opens
;;    in R mode by looking at the mode line and menubar.
;;
;; Upgrading your version of ESS.
;;
;; If (and only if) you use the above instructions for installing ESS,
;; when a new version of ESS is released, you can use the same method to
;; install the new version.  Repeat steps 2-7 for the new release of ESS,
;; and this time in step 6, if emacs finds that you already have the
;; special line ";;; ESS setup for version 5.2.12", it will highlight
;; those lines, and query whether you want to replace those two lines
;; with the new setup code.
;;
;; If you do upgrade ESS this way, bear in mind that your old version
;; will not be deleted from your filespace -- you will have to delete it
;; yourself.

;; TODO: possibly add a call to (byte-recompile-directory ess-lisp-dir
;; 0) so that lisp files are byte compiled.

;;; Highlighting (copied from reftex.el -- cheers Carsten!)
