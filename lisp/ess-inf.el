;;*;; Starting a process

If ess-plain-first-buffername, then initial process is number-free."
  (concat name
          (if (not (and ess-plain-first-buffername

(defun inferior-ess (&optional ess-start-args customize-alist no-wait)
  "Start inferior ESS process.

Without a prefix argument, starts a new ESS process, or switches
  to the ESS process associated with the current buffer.
With a prefix, starts the process with those args.
The current buffer is used if it is an `inferior-ess-mode'
or `ess-transcript-mode' buffer.

If `ess-ask-about-transfile' is non-nil, you will be asked for a
transcript file to use. If there is no transcript file, the buffer
name will be like *S* or *S2*.

Takes the program name from the variable `inferior-ess-program'.
An initialization file (dumped into the process) is specified by
`inferior-ess-start-file', and `inferior-ess-start-args' is used to
accompany the call for `inferior-ess-program'.

When creating a new process, the process buffer replaces the
current window if `inferior-ess-same-window' is non-nil.
Alternatively, it can appear in its own frame if
`inferior-ess-own-frame' is non-nil.

\(Type \\[describe-mode] in the process buffer for a list of commands.)"

  ;; Use the current buffer if it is in inferior-ess-mode or ess-trans-mode
  ;; If not, maybe ask about starting directory and/or transcript file.
  ;; If no transfile, use buffer *S*
  ;;
  ;; This function is primarily used to figure out the Process and
  ;; buffer names to use for inferior-ess.

  ;; Once, long ago, it was used for switching buffers, but we don't
  ;; do that any more (at least not from here).

(defun inferior-ess-mode ()
  "Major mode for interacting with an inferior ESS process.
Runs an S interactive job as a subprocess of Emacs, with I/O through an
Emacs buffer.  Variable `inferior-ess-program' controls which S
is run.

Commands are sent to the ESS process by typing them, and pressing
\\[inferior-ess-send-input].  Pressing \\[complete-dynamic-complete]
completes known object names or filenames, as appropriate.  Other
keybindings for this mode are:

\\{inferior-ess-mode-map}

When editing S objects, the use of \\[ess-load-file] is advocated.
`ess-load-file' keeps source files (if `ess-keep-dump-files' is non-nil) in
the directory specified by `ess-source-directory', with the
filename chosen according to `ess-dump-filename-template'. When a file is
loaded, `ess-mode' parses error messages and jumps to the appropriate file
if errors occur. The ess-eval- commands do not do this.

Customization: Entry to this mode runs the hooks on `comint-mode-hook' and
`inferior-ess-mode-hook' (in that order).

You can send text to the inferior ESS process from other buffers containing
S source. The key bindings of these commands can be found by typing
C-h m (help for mode) in the other buffers.
    `ess-eval-region' sends the current region to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-buffer' sends the current buffer to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-function' sends the current function to the ESS process.
    `ess-eval-line' sends the current line to the ESS process.
    `ess-beginning-of-function' and `ess-end-of-function' move the point to
        the beginning and end of the current S function.
    `ess-switch-to-ESS' switches the current buffer to the ESS process buffer.
    `ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS' switches the current buffer to the ESS process
        buffer and puts point at the end of it.

    `ess-eval-region-and-go', `ess-eval-buffer-and-go',
        `ess-eval-function-and-go', and `ess-eval-line-and-go' switch to the S
        process buffer after sending their text.
    `ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer' moves an S object into a temporary file
        and buffer for editing
    `ess-load-file' sources a file of commands to the ESS process.

Commands:
Return after the end of the process' output sends the text from the
    end of process to point.
Return before the end of the process' output copies the sexp ending at point
    to the end of the process' output, and sends it.
Delete converts tabs to spaces as it moves back.
C-M-q does Tab on each line starting within following expression.
Paragraphs are separated only by blank lines.  Crosshatches start comments.
If you accidentally suspend your process, use \\[comint-continue-subjob]
to continue it."

;; Dear Tony Rossini,

;; I was having trouble looking at the search list under ess.  When I
;; started up multiple inferior processes---each for a different
;; dialect---ess-mode would issue the wrong variant of the "search"
;; command when I typed C-c C-s.  In case it is useful let me tell you
;; what I did to get it to work for me.

;; I added the component:
;;  (inferior-ess-search-list-command . "search()\n")
;; to S+3-customize-alist and R-customize-alist, and then I redefined the
;; ess-create-temp-buffer function as follows:
(defun ess-create-temp-buffer (name)
  "Create an empty buffer called NAME."
  (let ((buff (get-buffer-create name))
        (elca (eval ess-local-customize-alist)))
    (with-current-buffer buff
      (erase-buffer)
      (ess-setq-vars-local elca buff))
    buff))
;;These two steps seem to insure that the temporary buffer in which the
;;search results appear has the correct version of the local variables.
;;I am not that well acquainted with the ess code and don't know whether
;;this is a good fundamental way of fixing the problem, or even whether
;;or not this breaks some other feature of ess-mode that I never use.
;;Thanks for listening.
;;Ed K.
