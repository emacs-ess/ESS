;; This provides a dired-like buffer for R objects.  Instead of
;; operating on files, we operate on R objects in the current
;; environment.  Objects can be viewed, edited, deleted, plotted and
;; so on.

;;; Commentary:

;; Installation and usage.
;;
;; Load in this library, e.g. with the command:
;; (autoload 'ess-rdired "ess-rdired" "View *R* objects in a dired-like buffer." t)
;;
;; After loading this file, do "M-x R" to start an R session, then
;; create a few variables:
;; s <- sin(seq(from=0, to=8*pi, length=100))
;; x <- c(1, 4, 9)
;; y <- rnorm(20)
;; z <- TRUE

;; Then in Emacs, do "M-x ess-rdired" and you should see the following in
;; the buffer *R dired*:
;;        mode length
;;   s numeric    100
;;   x numeric      3
;;   y numeric     20
;;   z logical      1

;; Type "?" in the buffer to see the documentation.  e.g. when the
;; cursor is on the line for `s', type 'p' to plot it, or `v' to view
;; its contents in a buffer.  Then type 'd' to mark it for deletion.

;; How it works.

;; Most of the hardwork is done by the R routine .rdired.objects(),
;; which, when called, produces the list of objects in a tidy format.
;; This function is stored within the lisp variable `ess-rdired-objects',
;; and can be altered to provide other information if you so need it.
;; (Martin Maechler suggested providing output from str() here.)

;; Tested on Emacs 21.2, 21.3 pretest and XEmacs 21.1.14, using R 1.6.

;; Todo - compare functionality with ess-mouse-me (ess-mous.el).

;; Todo - How to select alternative environments?  Currently only
;; shows objects in the .GlobalEnv?  See BrowseEnv() in 1.6.x for way
;; of browsing other environments.

;; Todo - problem with fix -- have to wait for fix() command to return
;; before *R* buffer can be used again.  This can get stuck, umm. not
;; sure what is going wrong here.  Maybe add a hook to the temp buffer
;; so that when buffer is killed, we send an instruction to R to
;; update the value of the variable to the contents of the buffer.
;; This way *R* doesn't have to wait.

;; Todo - small bug in .rdired.objects -- if we have a variable called
;; `my.x', its value is replaced by the value of my.x used in the
;; sapply() calls within .rdired.objects().

;;; Code:

(defvar ess-rdired-objects ".rdired.objects <- function(objs) {
  if (length(objs)==0) {
    \"No objects to view!\"
  } else {
  mode <- sapply(objs, function(my.x) {
    eval( parse( text=sprintf('data.class(get(\"%s\"))', my.x))) })
  length <- sapply(objs, function(my.x) {
    eval( parse( text=sprintf('length(get(\"%s\"))', my.x))) })
  d <- data.frame(mode, length)

  var.names <- row.names(d)

  ## If any names contain spaces, we need to quote around them.
  quotes = rep('', length(var.names))
  spaces = grep(' ', var.names)
  if (any(spaces))
    quotes[spaces] <- '\"'
  var.names = paste(quotes, var.names, quotes, sep='')
  row.names(d) <- paste('  ', var.names, sep='')
  d
  }
}; .rdired.objects(ls())"

line of this string should be the instruction to call the
function which prints the output for rdired.")
