	* ess-site.el: Do not quote lambda expressions.
	* noweb-font-lock-mode.el (noweb-font-lock-fontify-chunk-by-number):
	Use `syntax-begin-function' when available instead of
	`font-lock-beginning-of-syntax-function' (obsolete in Emacs 23.3).
	Avoid `progn' in `cond' and some other minor code cleanup.

2012-05-05  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-custom.el (inferior-STA-program-name): is now "stata" as it
	should be and not "env" + all the support modifications.

	* ess-sta-l.el (ess-help-STA-sec-keys-alist): corrections and
	additions to sections keys and regular expressions for STATA.

	* ess-s-l.el (S-common-cust-alist)
	* ess-sta-d.el (ess--STA-retrive-topics-from-search)
	(ess-get-STA-help-topics): customizable topic retrieval. Stata has
	same interactive facilities as R.

	* ess-custom.el (inferior-STA-args): customizable stata arguments.
	(inferior-STA-program-name): program name is "stat" as it should
	be (and not "env").

2012-05-02  Sam Steingold  <sds@gnu.org>

	* ess-r-args.el (tooltip-show-at-point): Do not use the assoc
	package (which is obsoleted by Emacs 24.2 anyway), use let
	instead, it is cleaner and more reliable.

        Remove incorrect description of the GPL

        A couple files had the following in their header:

        In short: you may use this code any way you like, as long as you
        don't charge money for it, remove this notice, or hold anyone liable
        for its results.

        This is not an accurate description of the GPL, and should therefore not appear
        in the headers.

        Clean up all whitespace according to settings from ".dir-locals.el"

        Uses `whitespace-cleanup' to set a consistent style for whitespace throughout
        the project. This can be applied with:


        (defun recursive-files (dir func)
          (loop with before-save-hook
                for (file is-dir)
                in (directory-files-and-attributes dir t ".*\.el$")
                if is-dir
                do (recursive-files file form)
                else
                do (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect file)
        	     (apply func)
        	     (basic-save-buffer)
        	     (kill-buffer))))

        (recursive-files 'whitespace-cleanup)

        Again, this can be run from "emacs -Q" after "(require 'cl)"

        Directory-local variables for whitespace cleanup.

        Use the `whitespace' library for the cleaning.

        Convert files to `utf-8-unix' coding system.

        The default coding system to use going forward, `utf-8-unix', is set as a
        directory-local variable in ".dir-locals.el".

        To force all elisp files to use the `utf-8-unix' coding system, the following
        code will recursively walk through all elisp files in the specified directory
        set the encoding system, and save the file.

        (require 'cl)

        (defun recursive-files (dir func)
        (loop with before-save-hook
        for (file is-dir)
        in (directory-files-and-attributes dir t ".*\.el$")
        if is-dir
        do (recursive-files file form)
        else
        do (with-current-buffer (find-file-noselect file)
        (apply func)
        (basic-save-buffer)
        (kill-buffer))))

        This can be invoked as follows:

        (recursive-files "/path/to/ess" '(lambda () (set-buffer-file-coding-system 'utf-8-unix)))

        To ensure no other variables from the user environment impact the process, this
        code can be run in "emacs -Q", which doesn't load any startup files (outside of
        the emacs core).

        This function could perhaps be split out, named better, and put in its own file.

        Reformat all headers to be consistent.

        Summary of changes made:

        * Correct first- and last-line format. Preferred is three semicolons, file name,
        either three dashes and the description (first line) or the string "ends
        here" (last line).

        * Changed header comment lines to match conventions. "Author" and "Maintainer"
        headers are singular, even when there are multiple authors or maintainers.

        * Use the correct number of semicolons for each header section. Regular comments
        should have two semicolons; section headers, such as "Commentary" or "Code"
        should have three.

        * Fixed "Keywords" header comments. There is a standard-ish set of keywords used
        in Emacs, available through `finder-by-keyword'; this commit uses those
        conventions. Also, keywords are now separated by comma then space and do not
        have a trailing period.

        * Trailing newline at end of file. A few files lacked this, which makes
        subsequent diffs which modify the last line unnecessarily noisy.

        * Moved "Code" section marker before any and all code in a file.

2012-04-02  Sam Steingold  <sds@gnu.org>

	* ess-tracebug.el (ess-bp-kill): Bug fix: `called-interactively-p'
	requires an argument; fix it as recommended in the doc for

	takes care of compatibility.

2012-04-02  Sam Steingold  <sds@gnu.org>

	* ess-help.el (ess-help-mode-map): All supported emacsen have
	`set-keymap-parent'.

	* noweb-mode.el: Do not quote lambda forms, this is never needed.

2012-04-02  Sam Steingold  <sds@gnu.org>

	* ess-site.el: Rise up to the challenge: use `locate-file'
	instead of horrible adhockery to check if info can find ess.info.

2012-03-30  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-custom.el (ess-arg-function-offset-new-line): If a list of
	the form '(N), indent at the indentation + N

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-R-get-rcompletions, ess--funargs-command):
	workaround for enableJIT warnings for R > 2.14.2

2012-03-26  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-help.el (ess-skip-to-help-section): this issue is documented in 2 places
http://www.xemacs.org/About/XEmacsVsGNUemacs.html
http://www.xemacs.org/Documentation/21.5/html/cl_4.html
So, the schism goes back many years: circa 1997-1998.  However, the fix is not
If the keypress is meant to be a character, then
you wrap last-command-event as follows...

(if (featurep 'xemacs) last-command-char last-command-event)

2012-03-25  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-get-object-list): new arg exclude-first to allow
	exclusion of objects from .GlobalEnv in help completion.

	NULL in critical completion and eldoc actions.

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess-set-status): new argument no-timestamp
	to allow ess-command not to set the timestamp.

2012-03-20  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-roxy.el (ess-roxy-complete-tag): removed function advice for
	(ess-internal-complete-object-name) to reflect the new tab
	behavior and also made tab not hide roxy entry unless point is at
	the beginning of the line (so similar to org-mode's visibility
	cycling)
	(comint-dynamic-complete-functions): and dropped the advice
	to (ess-R-complete-object-name) as well.


2012-03-13  Henning Redestig  <henning@psc.riken.jp>

	* ess-roxy.el (ess-roxy-preview): put all R-code on one line to
	get rid f the +s

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess-mode-map): don't bind M-TAB in emacs 24.

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode-map): Don't bind M-TAB  in emacs 24, it's

	* ess-swv.el (ess-swv-PDF): ess-completing-read

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-goto-chunk): ess-completing-read

	of local process. That means eldoc and completion are available
	even if buffer is not associated with a process.

	of the doc object.
	(ess-display-help-on-object): killed buffer display bug fix,
	reported and fixed by Sam Steingold.

	(ess-help-mode-map): inherits form special-mode-map, "k" is
	kill-this-buffer instead of kill-buffer. "q" is quit-window
	instead of bury-buffer. (pointed by Sam Steingold)

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-funname.start, ess-function-arguments):
	execution bugs corrected and robustified  caching.

	* ess-r-args.el (ess-r-args-get): relies on ess-function-arguments now.

	* ess.el (ess-load-extras): new function to load extra features.

	* ess-tracebug.el (ess-tracebug-map): a couple of renames.

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode): (ess-load-extras)

2012-02-26  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-tracebug.el (ess-tracebug-prefix): set to nil, as to require
	the user to choose the binging.

2012-02-25  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-tracebug.el (ess-long+replacement): it's shorter "+ . +" now.

	* ess-custom.el (inferior-ess-S-prompt): small adjustment of the
	prompt for tracebug cuts.

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-function-arguments): modified the form of the
	returned value.

2012-02-23  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el:
	(ess-switch-to-ESS): force-buffer-current instead of
	make-buffer-current. Much more useful in interactive use, which
	this function is almost always used.
	(ess-force-buffer-current): New argument to auto-start process if
	the process died. This case was not treated before.

2012-02-21  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-eldoc.el (ess-eldoc-everywhere-p): controls whether to show
	args everywhere or only inside function call.
	(ess-eldoc): complete rewrite of ess-eldoc, to use argument
	completion api. Automatic caching + generic args + handling of
	complex expressions + calling process only when really needed.

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-function-arguments): optimized funarg retrieval.
	(ess-get-object-at-point): a very permissive version of
	symbol-at-point. Allows almost any R object.

2012-02-20  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess-set-status): set 'last-eval property
	giving the time of the last interaction with the process.

	* ess-r-d.el (ess--funargs-cache, ess-function-arguments): New
	uniform caching support for argument completion. Arg are reliably
	cached on first completion invocation. All completion mechanisms
	should use ess-function-arguments.
	(ess-funname.point): Retrieve the name of a function call and
	starting point of a call. All interfaces should use it for
	argument completion.

	* ess-r-args.el (ess-r-args-get): completes arguments for S3
	generic if found.

	* ess-r-d.el (ac-source-R, ac-source-R-objects)
	(ac-source-R-args): Completely rewrote the ac support. ESS now
	provides the above 3 sources to accomplish any completion taste.

2012-02-19  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-switch-to-ESS): Associates the buffer with
	current process. Make sense when the buffer is not yet associated
	with any process.
	(with-current-process-buffer): new macro to execute the &body
	inside current ess process buffer.
	(ess-command): removed PROMPT argument.
	(ess-command): removed sleeping, not relevant anymore argument
	still stays, apparently needed for dde.

2012-02-04  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-tracebug.el (ess-watch-mode): corrected watch-mode
	documentation and added the ? and d keys.

2012-02-03  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess--get-old-input:regexp): silent
	byte-compile on free var.

	* ess-tracebug.el (ess-tracebug-inject-source-p): better control
	source injection.
	(ess-eval-region2): removed eva-region, eva-linewise,
	eval-function fixes from tracebug (everything incorporated into
	the core).

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-function): complete rewrite to accommodate
	developer and tracebug and potentially other addons in the future.
	(ess-load-file) calls ess-tracebug-source-current-file if tb is
	active.

	* ess-developer.el: Many unifying changes, bug fixes. Follows
	ess-eval-visibly-p whenever possible. Implemented region and
	function devEvals.

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-region): moved ddeclient to lower level
	`ess-send-region'
	(ess-send-string, ess-send-region): consolidated these low-level
	work-horse functions.

2012-02-02  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-region): removed the archaic
	ess-synchronize-evals, a workaround for emacs 18.57.
	(ess-eval-region): is now aware of ess-tracebug and ess-developer.

2012-02-01  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-sos, ess-setRepositories, ess-setCRANMiror): added two more handy
	commands.

	(ess-roxyb-preview-text): new function for preview in text format

	* ess-rd.el (Rd-preview-help): solved nil file-name bug with roxy
	preview.

2012-01-28  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-developer.el (ess-developer-assign-function): integrated
	with ess-eval-function; also takes care of tracebug.

	* ess-tracebug.el (ess-tracebug-assign-function): tracebug doesn't
	reassign ess-eval-function anymore (it's integrated now in ESS)
	(ess-process-send-string): moved into ess-inf.el

	* ess-inf.el (ess-process-send-string): low level wrapper for
	process-send to enable pre-processing of input string. Currently
	removes empty lines when debugging is active.

	* ess-inf.el (ess-load-file): if in developer mode call

2011-11-13  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-help.el (ess-helpobj-at-point): modified the name of
	ess-read-helpobj-name-default to a more intuitive one and
	consistent with emacs conventions.

	* ess-custom.el (ess-help-pop-to-buffer): If non-nil ess-help
	buffers are given focus during the display.
	(ess-ido-flex-matching): if you don't use ido flex matching but
	still want it for ESS, here it is.

	* ess-help.el (ess-display-help-on-object): put cache update on
	universal argument, it also regenerates the help buffer as
	before. Removed curr-* kludge which was not necessary. Removed the
	handling of help buffer into separate function.
	(ess-help-type): local variable in help files holding the help
	type symbol. So far, 'help, 'index, 'vignette.
	(ess-help-object): local in help files holding the name of the
	help object, i.e. name of the package for index and help topic for
	ordinary help.
	(ess-help-mode-map): new keys - i for index, v for vignette, w for
	help in web-browser. "q" key is not burring the buffer instead of
	jumping to the end of ESS. C-c C-z is standard combination for
	that action.
	(ess-help-mode-menu): new menu entries for index vignette and
	browse in web-browser.
	(ess-find-help-file): This one does not do the prompt processing
	anymore. Everything is done in ess-completing-read now.
	(ess-get-help-topics-list): topics are now list of strings instead
	of alist. IDO and emacs handles them better. A workaround is
	implemented for Xemacs to use alist in ess-completing-read.
	-------------
	New functions:
	(ess-display-index): linked index with ido request.
	(ess-R-display-vignettes, ess-display-vignettes): display
	vignettes in nicely formatted, linked help buffer. In xemacs emits
	the call to browseVignettes() instead.
	(ess-display-help-in-browser): pop the current help page in
	browser.
	(ess--switch-to-help-buffer): display help buffers, consistently
	with `ess-help-pop-to-buffer' and `ess-help-own-frame'.

	* ess.el (ess-completing-read): moved code around.

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-function): integrated ess-developer in ess-eval-function
	Works only for R, useful for S as well?

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode): integrated mode-line-indicator.

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess-mode): integrated mode-line-indicator.

	* ess-custom.el (ess-mode-line-indicator): added dynamic mode-line
	indicator. Mode line of ess-mode is now in sync with the
	associated process. This feature is used by ess-developer and
	ess-tracebug.  Xemacs does not have the necessary support for it.

2011-11-12  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>


	* ess.el (ess-completing-read): new function to use for completion
	in ESS. It uses ido completion mechanism whenever available, and
	falls back on classical completing-read  otherwise.

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-install.packages): fast way to instal packages
	with ido interface.

	* ess-custom.el (ess-use-ido): users can disable ido if they
	don't want it.
	(ess--completing-hist): new internal variable to store completion
	history.

	* ess-inf.el (ess-get-words-from-vector): addapted regular
	expression to match "\"", this was breaking the command
	before. See etc/R-ESS-bugs.el (bug 1).

	Added comment on max.print truncating the vector in the
	doc string (bug 2 in etc/R-ESS-bugs.el). Sill not sure if
	should wrap the code automatically or leave it to the user.

2011-11-11  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

	* ess-r-d.el (R-customize-alist): added
	`inferior-ess-command-prompt' to R-customize-alist. Solves bug 3
	in etc/R-ESS-bugs.el.

	* ess-custom.el (inferior-ess-command-prompt): new prompt regexp
	to be used specifically in ess-command. If nil (the default)
	ess-command uses `inferior-ess-primary-prompt' as it was before.

	* ess-inf.el (ess-command): Anchoring the prompt to the end of
	buffer in order to avoid premature prompt detection (see
	etc/R-ESS-bugs.el bug 4). Moved ..ok{ess-command} inside
	unwind-protect. Before it was ..ok even when ess-command failed.
	(ess-prompt-wait): Added new required parameter PROMPT-REG for the
	local prompt regexp to be passed explicitly. Before, it was using
	global value of the prompt regexp.
	Dropped start-of-output argument. It's never used in ess-code and
	had confusing meaning wich was not even documented.

2011-11-03  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (sas-fix-life-tables): if read-only,
	then toggle to read-write first

	* ess-help.el (ess-get-help-aliases-list): Choose whether to use
	.readRDS() or readRDS() based on R version.

2011-08-30  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	after loading tex.

2011-08-18  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-bugs-d.el (ess-bugs-switch-to-suffix): let's not
	magnify burn-in (via the thinning multiple)

2011-08-17  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-r-versions): Add "R32" and "R64" if working on a
	mac.

2011-07-28  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-bugs-d.el (ess-bugs-switch-to-suffix): complete
	support for thinning:  ESS[BUGS] appears to be ready
	for release

2011-07-27  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-s-l.el (ess-insert-S-assign): factored out from

	* ess-bugs-d.el (ess-bugs-font-lock-keywords): adding
	keywords that are members of both the OpenBUGS script
	language and BRUGS (why the 2 sets are not the
	same; I don't know)

	ESS[BUGS] and ESS[JAGS] is now functional.  ESS[JAGS]
	is pretty complete, but ESS[BUGS] is still in development,
	however, it does appear to work.

2011-06-22  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-bugs-d.el (ess-bugs-font-lock-keywords): updating to
	new OpenBUGS scripting language (incomplete so far, but

	* ess-bugs-d.el/ess-custom.el/ess-compat.el:
	fix a bunch of bugs and get ESS[BUGS] working for GNU Emacs
	utilize (ess-sleep) after (shell) which, apparently, is
	necessary for GNU Emacs; rename ess-sleep-for to
	ess-sleep-for-shell and move to ess-custom

2011-06-20  Henning Redestig  <henning@psc.riken.jp>

	* ess-roxy.el (ess-roxy-get-function-args): Enhancement to handle

	and restores the point after revert

2011-06-07  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (sas-fix-life-tables): re-implemented
	with re-search-forward/replace-match
	(fix-page-breaks): re-implemented

	probably not very useful to anyone at this point, but
	it does compile without any warnings!

2011-05-27  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-a.el: re-implemented rudimentary RTF support since
	GNU Emacs does not work with rtf-support.el (sadly, XEmacs
	has had this for over a decade); does NOT support font re-sizing;
	you are stuck with a point size of 8.  Enjoy!

2011-05-26  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-paragraph-and-step): Apply Erik Iverson's
	patch from Feb 2011, so that after evaluating the paragraph, it
	skips any blank lines and comments, just like
	ess-eval-line-and-step.
	(ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step): As above.

2011-05-08  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-show-buffer): Fixed minor typo in doc string.

2011-05-05  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-a.el: several changes necessary to
	support GNU Emacs for ESS[SAS] batch

2011-04-06  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): most
	common SAS/Graph statements now added

2011-04-01  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): adding
	a few common SAS/Graph statements, but much more is
	left to be done

2011-03-25  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (sas-fix-life-tables): I assume that sed
	command worked for someone at some point, but it was not
	working for me; and it was overly complicated, so I
	simplified; hopefully it works now; please test.

2011-03-02  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el: Standardized function names for consistency.
	Thanks to Cesar Rabak (ESS-help).

2011-02-28  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-site.el, ess-bugs-l.el, ess-bugs-d.el, ess-jags-d.el:
	Batch BUGS is back!  With OpenBUGS, a batch BUGS script is
	available for Linux.  Therefore, since it seems that BUGS
	and JAGS must co-exist (rather than a transition from BUGS
	to JAGS), .bug files are in ESS[BUGS] mode and .jug files
	are in ESS[JAGS] mode.  ESS[BUGS] now works like ESS[JAGS]
	rather than the orignal mode ESS[BUGS] mode which was
	difficult to maintain.  However, ESS[BUGS] needs a lot of
	work such as support for thinning, multiple data files,
	etc.

2011-02-14  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-swv.el (ess-swv-add-TeX-commands): Use "%t" instead of "%s"
	when Sweave'ing via AUCTeX.

2011-02-13  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-custom.el (ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p): New customizable
	variable, which defaults to nil, to determine whether AUCTeX
	interface is enabled or not.

	* ess-swv.el: New functions to allow working with Sweave via
	AUCTeX.

	* ess-custom.el (ess-program-files, ess-program-files-64)
	(ess-SHOME-versions, ess-SHOME-versions-64)
	(inferior-S+6-program-name, inferior-Sqpe+6-program-name)
	(inferior-Sqpe+6-SHOME-name): Pathnames for all 32-bit and 64-bit
	versions of Sqpe.  Add the most recent "/TIBCO/splus82" and make
	it the default.
	* ess-sp6w-d.el (ess-sqpe-versions-create): Give the function an
	argument of pathnames and an indicator whether they are 32-bit or
	64bit pathnames.

	and variables to find all 32-bit and 64-bit versions of Sqpe.

	use "-32bit" / "-64bit" in the bi-arch cases.


2011-01-19  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-rd.el (Rd-preview-help): Quote filename to prevent spaces in
	filenames causing problems running the shell-command.

2011-01-12  Richard M. Heiberger  <rmh@temple.edu>

	* ess-site.el (ess-rterm-version-paths): extend to find all 32-bit

	convention using the architecture-specific i386 and x64
	subdirectories and the older R-2.11.x naming convention.
	* ess-r-d.el (ess-rterm-arch-version): Isolate this function from within
	ess-r-versions-create to construct an architecture-specific name
	for VERSION, an absolute path to R on Windows.
	* ess-r-d.el (ess-r-versions-create): Remove

2010-12-13  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-help.el: Do not use (mapcar 'list ...) construct in
	`ess-get-help-files-list', and `ess-get-help-aliases-list', since
	we only need to create lists of lists in `ess-find-help-file',
	where it's needed for useful completion.
	Always return the existing `ess-help-topics-list' list if one
	exists for the current process.

2010-11-01  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-help.el (ess-find-help-file): Implemented caching of help

	PROCs up to v. 9.22

2010-09-30  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): many ERROR
	and WARNING messages end in period, period single space or
	period double space (the double space coming from ancient
	typewriter trained typists like myself)

2010-09-21  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	name

2010-07-29  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* Makefile (clean): 4394 Reverted this rule to the previous
	version since it was intended to also clean files with older
	names.  Removed 'ess-rdired.elc' from this rule, since it is
	already in the ELC variable, and "clean" removes those files.
	However, kept the fixed 'ess-xls-d.elc' and 'ess-vst-d.elc' rules.

2010-07-28  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-inf.el: 4369 Corrected autoloading of
	`ess-R-complete-object-name' (due to old renaming below).

	* ess-inf.el (ess-complete-filename): Use
	comint-dynamic-complete-filename so that filename is not expanded.

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-R-complete-object-name): If there are no
	possible-completions, should return nil, so that when this
	function is called from comint-dynamic-complete-functions, other
	functions can then be tried.  This should fix bug that history
	expansion was not working (reported by Vinu Jacob).

2010-06-10  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-r-d.el (ess-dirs): give a message, and also set ess-directory.

	* ess-help.el (ess-find-help-file): 4318 Replaced `delete-dups' by
	`ess-uniq-list', since XEmacs doesn't know about it.

	* ess-rutils.el: 4345 Redesigned menu generation and key binding
	definitions so that Xemacs understands them.

2010-06-03  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	available) after calling rdired.

2010-05-23  Richard M. Heiberger  <rmh@temple.edu>

	* ess-site.el, ess-r-d.el: Detect cases when `R/R-x.y.x' exists and
	`R/R-x.y.z/bin/Rterm.exe' does not exist.  In `ess-find-rterm' in file
	`ess-r-d.el', replace such values with `nil'.  In `ess-site.el',
	use `ess-flatten-list' to remove the `nil'.

2010-05-20  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-a.el (ess-sas-file-path/ess-sas-rtf-portrait):
	creation of portrait RTFs with the ESS[SAS] font sizes
	for non-ESS[SAS]-related buffers, such as .el, now
	allowed, but functionality is somewhat limited
	TODO: ess-sas-rtf-landscape

2010-05-19  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-custom.el (ess-eval-deactivate-mark): The default is true
	since ESS version 5.9, except on XEmacs which doesn't have
	\\[deactivate-mark] and friends

2010-05-18  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-linewise): Partially work around a bug
	in GNU Emacs 23.x; thanks to Markus Triska; see
	http://article.gmane.org/gmane.emacs.ess.general/4366

2010-05-18  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-custom.el (ess-own-style-list): New customized variable.
	(ess-add-style): New function, to allow new indentation styles to
	be added.
	Nine indentation variables no longer defcustom, as they are set
	through the `ess-set-style' code, and thus not directly changeable
	by the user via customize.

2010-05-17  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-help.el: 4278 `ess-find-help-file' now calls the additional
	function `ess-get-help-aliases-list' so that it offers completion
	on aliases, in addition to object names, removing duplicates.

2010-05-17  Richard M. Heiberger  <rmh@temple.edu>

	* ess-site.el: I added a call to `w32-short-file-name' on each item
	in `ess-rterm-version-path'.  Otherwise Windows can't find files
	with embedded spaces in the directory name.

	I redefined S in Windows.  Now it gives a message to start the S
	GUI from the icon and then connect to it with M-x `S-existing'.
	This applies to M-x S, to the S menu item, and to clicking on the
	icon.

	* ess-sp6w-d.el: turned off a few more `use-dialog-box' and put in
	some more `w32-short-file-name' calls.

2010-05-16  Richard M. Heiberger  <rmh@temple.edu>

	* ess-sp6w-d.el, ess-r-d.el: set `use-dialog-box' to nil for Windows.
	Old version of Windows can't load directories from the dialog.

	* ess-site.el: I revised `ess-rterm-version-path' so it will find
        both 64-bit and 32-bit versions of R on 64-bit Windows.  I tested it
        on 64-bit Windows 7 and 32-bit Windows XP.

	* ess-toolbar.el: add C-c C-c
	`ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step' to `ess-toolbar-items'.
	Started to change spluslogo to splus_icon_small logo (from S-Plus 7 and
	earlier to S+ 8).  This needs an xpm and ppm file and permission
	from TIBCO.  I wrote to Lou Bajuk asking for permission.

2010-05-13  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): we can safely
	assume that any line starting with @ is not a NOTE, ERROR
	or WARNING.  TODO; create separate .sas and .log keywords

2010-05-10  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-swv.el (ess-swv-PDF): 4251 Fixed command string for
	`shell-command' to view file.

2010-05-05  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-site.el (ess-font-lock-mode): is alone determining the
	turn-on-font-lock setting in the major modes' hooks.

	* ess-roxy.el (ess-roxy-preview-Rd): more careful checking if
	require(roxygen) works.

2010-05-03  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-region): don't call
	deactivate-mark unless it is bound

2010-04-26  Henning Redestig  <henning.red@googlemail.com>

	* ess-roxy.el (ess-roxy-insert-args): do not add param field to
	functions without arguments

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode-menu): menu entries for editing roxygen
	entries

2010-04-16  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el (ess-rutils-keys): 4298 Turn on by default, now
	that bindings do not interfere with anything.

2010-04-15  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el: 4297 Unconditionally activate submenu Rutils, and
	changed key bindings to avoid using 'C-c c' (reserved for users).

2010-04-14  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el (ess-rutils-htmldocs): 4296 Fixed doc string.

2010-04-13  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el: 4290 Incorporated R function
	.rutils.help.start(), defined in etc/ess-rutils-help-start.R so
	that `ess-rutils-htmldocs' is now fully functional.
	(ess-rutils-rhtml-fn): 4294 Use `expand-file-name' to define path
	to ess-rutils-help-start.R.
	Reintroduced autoloading of ess-rdired.el; we really need it.

2010-04-11  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el: 4271 Provided optional argument REMOTE to
	`ess-rutils-htmldocs', fixed doc strings throughout.

2010-04-10  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-s-l.el (S-indent-line): also consider '#!'; using patch
	from Jeffrey Arnold
	* ess-site.el (interpreter-mode-alist): ditto
	* ess-mode.el (ess-comment-indent): ditto

2010-03-25  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-roxy.el (ess-roxy-get-function-args): also remove tabs

2010-03-24  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-sas-l.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): although note
	is a keyword in SAS/GRAPH, it is not used very much, but
	the false positive %put note: ...; is used quite often;
	therefore, the note statement is no longer fontified

2010-03-24  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-roxy.el (ess-roxy-mode): font-lock-add-keywords etc is not
	available and hence not called for XEmacs.

2010-03-22  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-custom.el (ess-eval-deactivate-mark): change default to t

2010-02-16  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el: 4268 Removed `ess-rutils-chgdir', already
	available as `ess-change-directory' in ess-utils.el, and rebound

	names

2010-02-05  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	...' notation for binary variables.

2010-02-05  Sebastian P. Luque  <spluque@gmail.com>

	* ess-rutils.el: 4265 Placed `ess-rutils-keys' under the ess-R
	customization group, not under the inexistent ess-r.

2010-02-05  Henning Redestig  <henning@psc.riken.jp>

	* ess-custom.el (ess-user-full-name): defines the user name which

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-rtf-font-name): now you can
	specify the font that MS RTF are created with; previously,
	these were created with courier, however, this font is
	thin and hard to read with MS Office and OpenOffice

2009-10-06  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-cust.el (inferior-ess-r-help-command): New variable to allow
	htmlhelp to be set.
	* essd-r.el (R-customize-alist): Use above var.

2009-09-21  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-electric-brace): skeleton-pair
	takes precedence

2009-09-02  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-rtf-portrait): OpenOffice Writer
	and Microsoft Word have different default margins which
	often leads to the same document displayed differently
	in each of the applications.  The wider OOWriter margins
	are now enforced so that either application can be used to
	view the documents correctly.

2009-08-05  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-cust.el (ess-r-args-electric-paren): must default to nil
	requires a conscious decision to turn on since it will
	mysteriously override smart-paren features like skeleton-pair

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode): define "(" key only when
	ess-r-args-electric-paren is t for similar reasons

2009-06-16  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-trns.el (ess-transcript-send-command-and-move):
	patch supplied by tyler.smith@mail.mcgill.ca
	see the related discussion at
	https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/ess-bugs/2008q1/000489.html

2009-06-08  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-linewise): keep deactivate-mark local

2009-06-05  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords):
	missed an abbreviated keyword

2009-06-05  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-utils.el (ess-change-directory): New function.

2009-06-04  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-utils.el (ess-num-or-zero):
	added (ess-num-or-zero arg)
	If arg is a number, then return that number, otherwise return 0

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-goto): fix the long-time
	bug of generating an error in (ess-sas-goto "log")
	when .log does not exist

2009-06-03  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords):
	adding a few more rare NOTES

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode): turn off annoying
	message by default, pass nil to turn it back on
	(ess-set-style something nil)

2009-06-02  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): kill a
	false positive bug for ERRORs/WARNINGs

2009-06-01  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): in:
	needs to be a special case for some reason

2009-05-28  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): last tweak to
	comment statement identification (very optimistic)

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-goto-log): no longer highlighting error messages
 this feature never worked quite right (and was XEmacs only which is worse)
 after highlighting an error message, moving point would cause an unwanted
 highlighting between point and mark; why god, why?!?

2009-05-27  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords):
	get MPRINT right in the case where it is
	followed by a comment and add Pipe command=
	and fix functions finally

2009-05-26  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): make call
	functions explicit, correct a few omissions, add RX
	functions...  note that not all functions are yet on
	the list as there are LOTS of functions
	also, fixing a bug... int( should only be matched
	at the beginning of a word, however, it seems to
	also be finding MPRINT(.  there must be a bug
	in the font-locking code somewhere

2009-05-22  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-bugs.el, essd-bugs.el, essd-jags.el, essl-sas.el,
	essa-sas.el: update headers/copyrights

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords):
	fine-tuning ERRORs/WARNINGs

2009-05-21  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): a few
	minor changes, ERRORs/NOTEs/WARNINGs

2009-05-20  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): fix
	error messages that go to two lines and kill a
	long-running bug biting adjacent comments
	/* comment type 1 */ followed by
	* comment type 2 ;
	migration complete! (should have done it 9 years ago)
	there are certainly going to be some special/missed
	cases of false positives/negatives
	(bug reports and patches welcome!)

2009-05-19  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): more
	alphabetizing, re-arranging, etc.  99.95%

2009-05-18  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-toggle-sas-log-mode): really,
	really fixed now (3rd times a charm)

2009-05-15  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-eldoc.el/ess-roxygen.el/ess-toolbar.el:
	added GPLv2 or later header, etc.

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords):
	a few fixes for functions and a missed NOTE

2009-05-14  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords):
	major overhaul complete (99.9%)
	PROCs now highlighted
	most keywords recognized (however, some
	dataset options are still needed)
	NOTEs and WARNINGs better detected in .log

	(ess-sas-run-regexp-opt): the new font-locking
	is better in many ways than the old font-locking
	so the default is now to use it; set this
	variable to nil to use the old font-lock code

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-toggle-sas-log-mode):
	still trying to get this right, first kill
	.log buffer, then re-open (see below)

2009-05-13  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): a
	few more keywords, a bug-fix and some comment
	re-organization, 99.5%

2009-05-12  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): even
	more fixes

2009-05-11  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): more
	simplification/alphabetization; 99% complete

2009-05-08  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-font-lock.el (ess-font-lock-rmh, etc.): modify
	so they work on XEmacs

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): more fixes
	and some alphabetizing (seriously, let's keep these in
	order, otherwise, it is very difficult to maintain)
	95% of the hand-coded regexps now handled by regexp-opt,

2009-05-04  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-toggle-sas-log-mode): to re-font-lock,
	reverting may not be enough; killing buffer and re-opening is
	necessary in some circumstances

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): 3/4's of the way
	there.  regexp-opt code updated to a reasonable fax of the
	font-lock code it replaced.

2009-04-20  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (ess-sas-run-regexp-opt): the long overdue change
	from make-regexp to regexp-opt is under way.  Setting
	ess-sas-run-regexp-opt to something other than nil will result
	in the old make-regexp code to be used by regexp-opt.  This is
	a half-step in the right direction.  The regexp-opt code will
	be easier to maintain than the hand-coded regexps.  However,
	this means that the font-locking will revert to what it was
	circa 2001-2 :o(  Over time, this code will be upgraded so
	that the font-locking will be up-to-date with what is
	currently available and incorporate the changes necessary for
	v. 9.2 and beyond.

2009-04-01  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-mode-font-lock-keywords): add PROC MAPIMPORT

2009-03-16  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-toolbar.el (ess-make-toolbar-emacs): For Emacs 23, images
	need to be on image-load-path.  This variable is set at bottom of
	the file.

2009-03-13  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* essd-bugs.el (ess-bugs-mode): Set comment-start to provide basic
	comment functionality.

2009-03-05  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-rtf-portrait, ess-sas-rtf-us-landscape,
	ess-sas-rtf-a4-landscape): after creation, close rtf buffer,
	avoids an annoying confirmation question about visiting buffer

2009-02-26  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-bugs.el (ess-bugs-hot-arrow):
	Substitute <- for = key press

2009-01-30  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* essd-r-args.el (tooltip-show-at-point): New function.
	Contributed by Erik Iverson <iverson@biostat.wisc.edu>.
	(ess-r-args-show): Use tooltip-show-at-point.

2009-01-22  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode): use run-mode-hooks only in newer Emacsen

2009-01-08  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essddr.el (Rd-keywords): new + shuffling + comment

	* essd-sas.el (SAS-mode): activate a bug fix;
	BTW, it's for 22.3 and 22.2

2009-01-07  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essd-sas.el (SAS-mode): fix a bug in GNU Emacs 22.3.1
	which erroneously performs font-lock on lowercase only

2008-12-17  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-site.el: we no longer should be encouraging
	users to edit this file (except possibly in extraordinary
	circumstances in 2 places).  Therefore, I have removed
	all but 2 references to uncommenting of code.  However,
	the examples are instructive so they remain, but the
	wording does not suggest uncommenting.  This is only a half-step
	in the direction that we want to go.

2008-12-15  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essd-jags.el (ess-jags-switch-to-suffix, ess-jags-na-bug):
	adding 2 new local variables:  ess-jags-burnin and
	ess-jags-update.  ESS[BUGS] has similar variables, but
	the modern defaults are an order of magnitude bigger, so
	it seemed like creating new variables was warranted
	also, the "log" of the run is now .jog (like BUGS which
	is .bog); .out created too many problems since the BOA
	output files have that extension as well

2008-12-11  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-indent-line): update chunk vector first:
	fixes buglet {[Enter] in almost empty *.Rnw buffer} reported by
	Henric Nilsson.
	(noweb-code-quotes-handling): now *disables* by default the calling
	of the (noweb-hide-code-quotes) .. (noweb-restore-code-quotes) pair,
	consequently preventing catastrophic behavior in large *.Rnw files
	with "[[" in R output.

2008-12-04  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-mode.el/ess-trns.el: delete key no longer
	remapped to "backspace"

2008-12-04  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-site.el: ess-r-versions-created currently needed too.

2008-11-29  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* noweb-mode.el: TODO cleanup; notably replacing more
	(stringp (car (noweb-find-chunk))) by (noweb-in-code-chunk).

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-mode): use before-change-functions,
	noweb-chunk-boundary-changed etc; code from Markus Triska.


2008-11-28  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-electric-<): {from Markus Triska}: also
	insert a (closing) "@".

	* ess-emcs.el (w32-short-file-name): Xemacs 21.5(beta) on Windows
	does not know win32-short-file-name anymore, but mswindows-*.

2008-11-27  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-emcs.el (ess-has-tooltip): move from ./ess-cust.el and test
	for Emacs >= 21.x.
	Consequently ESS works again in 'emacs-20.7 -nw'.

2008-11-26  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-swv.el (ess-swv-menu): a version that "works" with Xemacs;
	still with a FIXME.

	* noweb-mode.el, ess-rdired.el: replace (next-line .) by
	(forward-line .); also get rid of compilation warning about
	noweb-font-lock-mode.

2008-11-25  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-mode): fix "add-local-hook" thinko;
	also correctly indent (and use ';;' for full-line comments)

2008-11-24  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essd-jags.el (ess-jags-mode): adding comment-region
	functionality to ESS[JAGS]

	* essd-jags.el (ess-jags-switch-to-suffix): JAGS 1.0.3 is
	very finicky about monitor-ing AND thin-ing; the syntax
	and semantics are primitive; most likely this will be
	re-visited in a future release of JAGS; in the time being,
	a minor change to ESS[JAGS] and the recommendation that
	variables be monitor-ed implicitly via the Local Variable
	ess-jags-monitor

2008-11-20  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-swv.el (noweb-minor-mode-menu): add to "Noweb" menubar menu.

2008-11-17  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* Makefile (essl-sas.elc): Added formerly
	unaccounted for essa-sas.el dependency.

	* Makefile (essl-bugs.elc/essd-bugs.elc/essd-jags.elc): Added formerly
	unaccounted for BUGS/JAGS targets/dependencies.

2008-11-14  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* essd-r.el (R-mode): Add keybinding (C-c C-o) for ess-roxygen-fn.

	* ess-site.el (ess-roxygen-fn): Add autoload.

	* ess-roxygen.el (ess-roxygen-fn): Ensure that newlines before and
	after template are inserted correctly.

2008-11-13  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essl-sas.el (SAS-editing-alist): M-x comment-region
	was not using /* */ style comments for some reason that
	I can't fathom.  It is now.

2008-11-10  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-mode): Only the local value of
	after-change-functions should be modified to avoid problems
	in other modes.  Special thanks for the bug report/fix from
	markus.triska@gmx.at

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-mode):  By convention, every major mode
	starts by calling `kill-all-local-variables'. Importantly, this
	automatically calls `change-major-mode-hook'. This is documented
	in the "Major Mode Conventions" of the Elisp info manual. Special
	thanks (again :o) for the bug report/fix from markus.triska@gmx.at

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode): `ess-mode' should use `run-mode-hooks'
	rather than `run-hooks', because it is a major mode.  This way,
	you ensure that `change-major-mode-hook' is called (and everything
	else).  Special thanks for the bug report/fix from
	david.reitter@gmail.com

2008-11-06  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-swv.el: fix for embedded blanks in PDF reader and PDF files

2008-10-28  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* ess-cust.el (ess-sta-delimiter-friendly): see below

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-linewise): Stata allows semi-colons to be
	used in batch, but not interactive processing.  This leads to
	madness when you are trying to step through a file that was
	written for batch with semi-colons.  Now, if you set
	ess-sta-delimiter-friendly to t (in the ess-Stata group),
	iESS[Stata] will convert semi-colons to newlines on-the-fly.
	Beware if you have string literals with embedded semi-colons
	as this simple fix does not check for such complexity.

2008-08-30  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-cust.el (ess-R-common-font-lock-keywords): new variable for
	better modularization
	(inferior-ess-R-font-lock-keywords): now with*OUT* the keywords.
	Ditto for -S- instead of -R- .

2008-08-25  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-end-of-function): more careful final advance.

2008-08-24  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-roxygen.el (ess-roxygen-fn): Use ##' for markup so that
	comments don't move upon reindentation.

2008-08-23  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-roxygen.el: New file.

2008-08-20  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* noweb-mode.el (noweb-set-chunk-code-mode): use
	(regexp-quote chunk-name) instead of just chunk-name,
	here and in another few cases.
	Thanks to a patch from  Rafael Laboissiere at Debian.

2008-07-30  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-region): (deactivate-mark)
	when the new customizable variable
	* ess-cust.el (ess-eval-deactivate-mark): is non-nil.

2008-07-28  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-end-of-function): tweak

2008-07-23  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-end-of-function): if not at end of line move further.

2008-07-22  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essd-r-args.el (ess-r-args-auto-show): only "act" if ess process
	is still active

2008-07-18  Rodney Sparapany  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* essd-jags.el (ess-jags-switch-to-suffix): using ess-jags-system;
	see long svn message

2008-06-12  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* essd-r.el (ess-R-complete-object-name): comint-bol given nil
	argument to work on XEmacs (the arg is optional on Emacs, but not
	in XEmacs).

2008-06-09  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-inf.el (get-ess-process): if NAME is not running, do not
	automatically restart a new process, if there are others running.

2008-06-03  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-cust.el (ess-default-style): Remove quote from RRR value.

2008-05-24  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-start-process-specific): new function,
	implementing the process (re)start of yesterday
	(get-ess-process): also call ess-start-process-specific) if the
	process is no longer running.
	(ess-eval-line-and-step): (save-excursion ..) even earlier.

2008-05-23  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-request-a-process): when there is no associated
	ess process, start R automagically if ess-language is "S"

2008-05-22  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* Makefile (ELC): Add ess-eldoc.elc to the ELC variable list.
	Debian bug 482351 reported by Sebastian Luque.

2008-05-19  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-inf.el: use make-local-variable 'comint-use... to silence warning

2008-04-10  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-cust.el (ess-use-R-completion): customizable boolean for this:

	* ess-inf.el (ess-internal-complete-object-name): new name for
	original (ess-complete-object-name).
	* ess-inf.el (ess-complete-object-name): now simple wrapper to
	either ess-R-complete-object-name or ess-internal-complete-object-name.

	* essd-r.el (R): use ess-R-complete-object-name for
	R versions >= 2.5.0 {where pkg 'rcompgen' became recommended};
	check for baseenv() only for older versions of R.

2008-04-07  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-emcs.el (ess-line-beginning-position): defalias renamed
	from original 'line-beg...' in order to be good emacs citizens.

2008-03-31  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essd-r.el (R-fix-T-F): remove "_" (and extraneous "\"); thanks to Stephen

2008-03-31  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-continued-statement-p): remove _ from regexp to
	fix Kurt's bug re indendation after NA_INTEGER_

2008-03-11  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-cust.el (custom): Remove old code checking if custom package
	is provided; custom is now in all recent versions of Emacs and
	XEmacs.

2008-03-11  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essd-r.el (ess-current-R-version, ess-current-R-at-least): two
	new utilities.
	* essd-r.el (ess-R-complete-object-name): modified from Jim
	MacDonald's 'alt-ess-complete-object-name, to work in R >= 2.7.0.

2008-03-05  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-R-input-sender): wrap into
	(save-current-buffer . ); thanks to patch from Lawrence Mitchell.

2008-01-17  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-noweb.el (ess-noweb-use-font-lock): change default
	from window-system to font-lock-mode

2008-01-08  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essl-s.el (ess-fix-miscellaneous): no 'literal in fixing ";  #"

2007-12-28  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* essd-sp6w.el (S+6-dialect-name): Make defcustom and change
	default to "S".  Change of default suggested by Tim Hesterberg.

2007-08-15  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essd-r-args.el (require 'tooltip): only when ess-has-tooltip

	* ess.el (ess-write-to-dribble-buffer): patch from Markus Triska
	<markus.triska@gmx.at>.  Most importantly, deactivate-mark is set
	to nil so that any active region is not affected.  (Without this,
	in transient-mark-mode in GNU Emacs, highlighting of the region is
	lost when moving over chunks, and M-h (= mark-paragraph) on chunks

	* ess-site.el (ess-sqpe-versions-created): Remove call to
	ess-newest-R, and instead allow R-newest to find the newest

	* ess-cust.el: Update many doc strings, and change some vars from
	defcustom to defvar.

2007-07-14  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	ess-r-version-time as it returns the date stamp of R as a string
	rather than a time in seconds.
	(ess-find-newest-date): New defun, replacing
	ess-which-newest-date.


2007-07-11  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	is also in ess-inf.el

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess-mode): Ensure font-lock-keywords-only
	is t (to fix bug in Emacs 22.1).  Other small changes:
	- using `member' rather than lots of `string=' comparisons.
	- replacing (if cond (progn ...)) by (when cond ...)
	- replacing:
	(make-local-variable some-var)
	(setq some-var val)
	with
	(set (make-local-variable some-var) val)


2007-06-27  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-site.el (ess-restore-asm-extns): use `when' rather than

	not search for other versions of R.

2005-12-13  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

		baseenv().
	(R): make sure 'baseenv()' will work.

2005-11-24  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essl-s.el (ess-fix-EQ-assign): slight improvement in regexp.

2005-11-24  AJ Rossini <blindglobe@gmail.com>

	* essd-r.el (R): cygwin, at least older versions, probably need to
	consider adding the --ess flag rather than the --no-readline,
	since we most likely are using Rterm and not R.

2005-11-22  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essl-s.el (ess-dump-args-and-go): don't use (replace-string ..)

	* essa-sas.el (ess-sas-submit-pre-command): make sure that if
	there is no shell, i.e. (= (getenv "SHELL") nil), that we don't

	* ess-toolbar.el (ess-add-icon-xemacs): Swap caddr for (nth 2)

	* essd-sp6.el (ess-s-versions-create): Use nth rather than car,

	(ess-s-versions): New variable.

2005-09-02  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* essd-r.el, ess-cust.el (ess-r-versions): Moved this variable
	from ess-cust.el.  (As a custom variable, it could be set after
	ess-site had been loaded, which is the time when its value is
	used.  Hence customized values were ignored.)
	(ess-r-versions-create): Apply unique to list of list of R
	binaries after stripping off the directory.  This prevents
	multiple entries with the same name occuring in the ESS -> Start
	Process -> Other menu.

2005-08-20  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* essl-sta.el (STA-syntax-table): allow // for comments

	* ess-menu.el (ess-imenu-S-generic-expression): adding SetAs(..),
	but also e.g., setGroupMethod(..)

2005-07-05  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-help.el (ess-help-bogus-buffer-p): Document NR-FIRST, and
	reinstate code such that if NR-FIRST is nil, we search just the
	first 120 characters of a help buffer to see if it is bogus.  Have
	removed check for R text of the form "Help for topic `rlm'..."
	since this is caught elsewhere (see below).
	(ess-display-help-on-object): In R help buffers, if
	options("help.try.all.packages" = TRUE) then ?rlm will list which
	packages rlm is defined in.  This help buffer is not bogus, but
	instead is now relabelled *help[R](rlm in packages)*.

2005-07-05  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-beginning-of-function): more helpful error

	comint-dynamic-complete-functions local hook.  Removed the value
	`t' from that hook to prevent the global value of that hook also
	being used.

2005-04-16  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-toolbar.el (ess-make-toolbar): If Emacs is running in a
	terminal, tool-bar-map is not defined (because tool-bars cannot be
	displayed) and hence we should not bother trying to make a
	tool-bar.

2005-04-15  A.J. Rossini  <blindglobe@gmail.com>

	* ess-swv.el: New file for Sweave, slightly modified from code
	done by David Whiting.

2005-04-08  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* essl-s.el (R-editing-alist): Changed comment-start to #
	and set comment-add to 1 so that ## is put on empty lines at

	inferior-ess-strip-ctrl-g): New defuns.

	* ess-inf.el (ess-quit-r): New function to handle killing an *R*
	process.  (ESS asks whether you wish to save image.)

	can be deleted in future ESS versions.

2004-12-24  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-emcs.el (ess-replace-regexp-in-string): New function,
	reapplied from Camm's patch.  This time the function is now used
	in all relevant customization-alists.  This function is needed
	since other elisp packages may also define
	replace-regexp-in-string.

2004-12-20  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-cust.el (ess-ms-slow): New variable.

	* ess-inf.el (ess-command): Condition use of sleep-for (to add

2004-12-04  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess-mode): setq inferior-ess-prompt at the

	buffer has a process.
	(ess-select-alist-dialect): Add colon to prompt string.

	* ess-inf.el (inferior-ess-mode): Set inferior-ess-mode here,
	rather than within ess-multi.  (ess-multi is not run when
	ess-remote is used, and so prompt was not set for remote buffers
	running ESS processes.)

	* ess-inf.el (ess-multi): Fix bug: when inferior-ess-own-frame is

	read-directory-name routine (dialog box when using mouse differs
	from read-file-name).  Thanks to John Fox for reporting this.

2004-08-03  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@bushmills.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode-menu): Change function name for the
	default entry in "Start Process -> Other" submenu from R to nil.
	When it was set to R, this caused the R toolbar icon to not work
	since this menu entry was being found rather than the real menu
	entry for R.


2004-07-09  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@bushmills.inf.ed.ac.uk>

	* ess-utils.el (ess-find-exec-completions): After checking that

	auto-generate defuns to allow other versions of Sqpe to be called.

2004-07-02  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@anc.ed.ac.uk>

	* essd-r.el (ess-r-versions-create): Do not set the value of
	ess-r-versions-created here, just return the required value.

	* ess-site.el (ess-versions-created): Tidy up the code for calling
	older versions of R and Sqpe.  Old version did not work on Unix,
	since ess-sqpe-versions-created was not bound.	New version checks
	that variable is bound before using it.

	* ess-utils.el (ess-flatten-list): Standard defun needed for
	flattening a list.  Copied from lpr.el.

	displayed on the running Emacs.

	* essd-r.el (ess-r-versions-create): Remove full pathname from

	* ess-toolbar.el: Add test at end to check for toolbar support.

	* ess-mode.el (ess-mode-menu): Add Sqpe and S+6-existing to
	"Start Process" menu but their active state is determined by
	ess-microsoft-p and so will be greyed out unless on microsoft.
	(SAS-menu): Simple wrapper to report error if SAS invoked on
	microsoft machine.

2004-06-20  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@anc.ed.ac.uk>

	* essd-sp6.el (S+6-mode): Hook in toolbar support.

	* essd-r.el (R-mode): Hook in toolbar support.

	* ess-toolbar.el: Update toolbar support so that we have only one

	simpler to use I feel.

2004-05-22  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@anc.ed.ac.uk>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-linewise): Try again to get the point at
	the end of the S buffer after evaluation.  Previous attempt still
	didn't work, but I forgot that I had set

	with that comint var set to nil.

2004-05-18  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@anc.ed.ac.uk>

	* ess-inf.el (ess-eval-linewise): If eob, remember to go to the
