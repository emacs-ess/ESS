o Improve on "Sweave mode" aka  "working with '*.Rnw'"  aka ess-noweb-mode.el

  - Latex <-> Pdflatex: should be `switchable' like in AUCtex
  - more things "to be like AUCtex:
	 ....
	 ...

  - Better/new keybindings

      + walk through idea (MM):
            - re-assign   C-c C-c to  "eval-chunk-and-step" (not yet there)
	    - may assign  C-c RET to  "eval-chunk[-and-go]"
	      where the ``-and-go'' part is switchable either by Prefix
	      (==> "C-u C-c RET" would mean "and-go") or also by a
	      customizable variable

Solve now:

1. Get ess-menu to "do the right thing" on startup.  Make sure that it
   is only started when sensible/available.


Solve later:

1. "ess-(new|change)-buffer-this-process" possible to detach processes
   from buffers.  (for sending output from a single buffer to many.
   This could be done by running a 2-stage filter (the "real" as the
   real, and the others as copies with append.
2. look at semantic for rewriting.
3. inferior-ess rewrite.
4.
