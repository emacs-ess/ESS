;;; Commentary:

;; AJR copied S+5 to be S+6.
;; AJR copied S4 to be S+5.
;; DB contributed the changes from ess-sp3-d.el to
;; ess-s4-d.el. (removed the old ugly approach).
;; This file defines Sp5 customizations for ess-mode.  Lots of thanks
;; to RMH and JMC for code and suggestions
;; Thanks to MM for making this sensible.

;; You now need to make sure you've defined if you are running 5.0 or 5.1.
;; Lots of things are broken between them, GRR...
