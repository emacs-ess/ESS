;;; Commentary:

;; This file contains functions for easily determining features of the
;; version of Emacs that we are using.

;;; Code:

(defun ess-sleep ()
  ;; FIXME: Not a "compatibility" thing any more, so move to ess-utils.el.
  "Put emacs to sleep for `ess-sleep-for-shell' seconds (floats work)."
  (sleep-for ess-sleep-for-shell))

;; for emacs <= 24.2 :
(unless (fboundp 'defvar-local)
  (defmacro defvar-local (var val &optional docstring)
    "Define VAR as a buffer-local variable with default value VAL.
Like `defvar' but additionally marks the variable as being automatically
buffer-local wherever it is set."
    (declare (debug defvar) (doc-string 3))
    ;; Can't use backquote here, it's too early in the bootstrap.
    (list 'progn (list 'defvar var val docstring)
          (list 'make-variable-buffer-local (list 'quote var)))))

(unless (fboundp 'setq-local)
  (defmacro setq-local (var val)
    "Set variable VAR to value VAL in current buffer."
    ;; Can't use backquote here, it's too early in the bootstrap.
    (list 'set (list 'make-local-variable (list 'quote var)) val)))

(provide 'ess-compat)
