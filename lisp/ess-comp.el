;;; Commentary:

;; This file sets up all compilation needs.

;;; Code:

(provide 'ess-comp)

;; Emacs doesn't include '.' in the emacs lisp load path.
(add-to-list 'load-path nil)

;; defvar'ed to nil in ./ess-site.el
(setq ess-show-load-messages t)

(defun ess-message (format-string &rest args)
  "Shortcut for \\[message] only if `ess-show-load-messages' is non-nil."
  (if ess-show-load-messages (message format-string args)))

;; These are required by every other file.
(ess-message "loading 'ess-compat ..")  (require 'ess-compat) ;set Emacsen diffs
(ess-message "loading 'ess-custom ..")  (require 'ess-custom) ;set variables
(ess-message "loading 'ess ..")       (require 'ess)      ;configure
(ess-message "loading 'ess-site ..")  (require 'ess-site) ;overload defaults
