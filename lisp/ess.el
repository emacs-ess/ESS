;;; Commentary:

;; PURPOSE
;;
;; Interface to the S, SAS, and XLisp dialects of statistical
;; programming languages, with potential extensions to other
;; languages.   Designed to be extendable to most other interactive
;; statistical programming situations.

;; BRIEF OVERVIEW
;;
;; Supports structured editing of S, SAS, and XLisp (statistics
;; programming languages) functions that are integrated with a
;; running process in a buffer.

;; THE ESS MAILING LIST
;;
;; There is an informal mailing list for discussions of ESS. Alpha
;; and beta releases of ESS are also announced here. Send mail
;; to ess-help-request@r-project.org to join.

;; OVERVIEW OF ESS
;;
;; S is a statistics programming language developed at Bell Labs
;; particularly suited for descriptive and exploratory statistics.
;; s-mode is built on top of comint (the general command interpreter
;; mode written by Olin Shivers), and so comint.el (or comint.elc)
;; should be either loaded or in your load path when you invoke it.
;;
;; Aside from the general features offered by comint such as
;; command history editing and job control, inferior S mode
;; allows you to dump and load S objects into and from external
;; files, and to display help on functions.  It also provides
;; name completion while you do these.  For more detailed
;; information see the documentation strings for inferior-ess,
;; inferior-ess-mode, ess-mode, and comint-mode.  There are also
;; many variables and hooks available for customizing (see
;; the variables below that have document strings that start
;; with an "*").

;; INSTALLATION
;; See README and S-site for details.
