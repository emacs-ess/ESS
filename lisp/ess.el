;;; Commentary:

;;; PURPOSE
;;;
;;; Interface to the S, SAS, and XLisp dialects of statistical
;;; programming languages, with potential extensions to other
;;; languages.	Designed to be extendable to most other interactive
;;; statistical programming situations.

;;; BRIEF OVERVIEW
;;;
;;; Supports structured editing of S, SAS, and XLisp (statistics
;;; programming languages) functions that are integrated with a
;;; running process in a buffer.

;;; THE ESS MAILING LIST
;;;
;;; There is an informal mailing list for discussions of ESS. Alpha
;;; and beta releases of ESS are also announced here. Send mail
;;; to ess-help-request@r-project.org to join.

;;; OVERVIEW OF ESS
;;;
;;; S is a statistics programming language developed at Bell Labs
;;; particularly suited for descriptive and exploratory statistics.
;;; s-mode is built on top of comint (the general command interpreter
;;; mode written by Olin Shivers), and so comint.el (or comint.elc)
;;; should be either loaded or in your load path when you invoke it.
;;;
;;; Aside from the general features offered by comint such as
;;; command history editing and job control, inferior S mode
;;; allows you to dump and load S objects into and from external
;;; files, and to display help on functions.  It also provides
;;; name completion while you do these.	 For more detailed
;;; information see the documentation strings for inferior-ess,
;;; inferior-ess-mode, ess-mode, and comint-mode.  There are also
;;; many variables and hooks available for customizing (see
;;; the variables below that have document strings that start
;;; with an "*").

;;; INSTALLATION
;;; See README and S-site for details.
