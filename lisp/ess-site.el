;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines all the site-specific customizations for ESS. It should be
;; edited on a per-site basis. Read the comments (1.1 in Section 1 to see if
;; ess-site.el must be edited. The final directory location of this file must be
;; supplied in ess-lisp-directory. The editing of remaining sections is
;; optional. It should then be byte-compiled, and users who wish to use ESS
;; should add the line:
;;
;;    (load "/PATH/TO/THIS/FILE/ess-site")
;;
;; (where /PATH/TO/THIS/FILE is the path to ess-site.elc: i.e. the value of
;; `ess-lisp-directory', below) to their .emacs file.
;;
;; Alternatively, if the file is already in a directory specified by
;; the load-path variable:
;;
;;    (require 'ess-site)
;;
;; will work.
;;
;; with XEmacs, this is simply:
;;
;;      (add-path "/path/to/ess/lisp-directory")
;;
;; with Emacs (and in general):
;;
;;      (setq load-path (cons "/path/to/ess/lisp-directory" load-path)

;;; Code:

;; provide here; otherwise we'll get infinite loops of (require ..):
(provide 'ess-site)

;;;; 1. Load path, autoloads, and major modes
;;;; ========================================
;;;
;;; (1.1) For most users the variable ess-lisp-directory will
;;; automatically be set correctly.  If you are working with an old
;;; emacs, one in which file-truename is not defined, then you might
;;; need to change the value of ess-lisp-directory to the directory
;;; which is to contain the file ess-site.elc.  This is probably the
;;; current directory, or the value of LISPDIR if it was set in the
;;; Makefile.

;;; 3. Customization (and examples) for your site
;;;; ===============================================


;;; (3.01) SOME PEOPLE (who will remain nameless) worry that novices
;;; won't like fancy buffer names for their first (and only :-)
;;; process.  To number all processes:
;;(setq ess-plain-first-buffername nil)

;;; (3.02) Some people have requested using the program name as part
;;; of the buffer.  Turned on for R.
;;(setq ess-use-inferior-program-name-in-buffer-name t)


;;; (3.1) Font-lock
;; The following two expressions automatically enable font-lock-mode
;; for ess-mode and inferior-ess-mode buffers.

;; no longer requiring  (window-system)  here:
(when ess-font-lock-mode
  (add-hook 'ess-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock t)
  (add-hook 'ess-transcript-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock t)
  (add-hook 'Rd-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock t)
  (add-hook 'inferior-ess-mode-hook 'turn-on-font-lock t))

;; If nil, then don't font-lock the input
;; if t, font-lock (default).
(setq inferior-ess-font-lock-input t) ; from RMH

;;; (3.2) Framepop.  Windows produced by ess-execute-objects etc. are
;;; often unnecessarily large. The framepop package makes such
;;; windows appear in a separate, shrink-wrapped frame. This will
;;; also affect other "temporary" windows such as those produced by
;;; C-h k, etc.  To enable:
;;;
;;; Works only with Emacs at this time.
;; (cond (window-system
;;       (require 'framepop)))

;;; (3.3) ess-keep-dump-files.
;;; Documentation:
;;; *Variable controlling whether to delete dump files after a successful load.
;;; If nil: always delete.  If `ask', confirm to delete.  If `check', confirm
;;; to delete, except for files created with ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer.
;;; Anything else (for example `always'): always keep and never delete.
;;; This variable only affects the behavior
;;; of ess-load-file.  Dump files are never deleted if an error occurs
;;; during the load.
;;;
;;; RH sez: I find the default `always' keep to be imperative.  The previous
;;; default was to throw away
;;; files at the wrong time (I think it was something like, if you M-x
;;; ess-load a file twice, while you are working on it, the file is
;;; deleted).  I believe source is real and the ESS object is temporary.
;;; The previous default behavior is dangerous for people who believe this way.
;;; It made sense only for people who believe the object is real
;;; and the source file temporary.
(setq ess-keep-dump-files "always")

;;; (3.4) ess-ask-for-ess-directory
;;; If t, will ask for the directory to use.  If nil, assumes the
;;; default (usually, the users home directory...).
;;now rather in ./ess-custom.el : (setq ess-ask-for-ess-directory t)

;;; (3.5) ess-directory default  (correlated with above)
;;; The default location for running the subprocess is configurable.
;;; By default, that is the default-directory (a lisp variable which
;;; initially contains the directory from which the inferior ESS
;;; statistical package/process  is started).
;;; For example, the following function (added to the pre-run-hook, by
;;; the line following it) will set the default directory to be your
;;; home directory:
;;;
;;(defun ajr:ess-set-directory ()
;;  "Set ess-directory to home."
;;  (setq-default ess-directory (file-name-as-directory (getenv "HOME"))))
;;(add-hook 'ess-pre-run-hook 'ajr:ess-set-directory)
;;;
;;; If you replace the setq-default line with:
;;;
;; (setq-default ess-directory (file-name-as-directory
;;                          (concat (getenv "HOME") "/ess/")))
;;;
;;; then it will always start up in the directory "ess" in your home
;;; directory.
;;;
;;; The default is to have ess to start up in the current buffer's
;;; directory (the one in which you started the inferior ESS
;;; statistical package/process).  This is obtained
;;; by setting ess-directory to nil, i.e.
;; (setq-default ess-directory nil) ; this is the default.

;;; 3.6 Example of formatting changes

;;; Formatting and indentation patterns are defined in ess-custom.el, please
;;; see ess-custom.el for exact definitions of these variable settings.
;;; To change them (eg, follow changes suggested by Terry Therneau),
;;; you need one or both of the following lines:

;;; 4.0 SAS configuration

;;; Beginning with ESS 5.1.13, we have editing options in SAS-mode.
;;; The default behavior is as it was in prior releases.
;;;
;;; There are two sets of alternatives.
;;;   1. Editing SAS-mode files.
;;;   1a. Default: TAB is bound to sas-indent-line.
;;;       Current line is correctly indented as SAS code.  Equivalent to
;;;(setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle nil) ;; default TAB in sas-mode
;;;   1b. Optional: TAB is bound to tab-to-tab-stop and inserts up to 4
;;;       columns at a time.  C-TAB moves backwards and deletes characters
;;;       up to 4 columns at a time.
;;;       The following line is for the optional behavior.
;;;(setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle t)   ;; optional TAB and C-TAB in sas-mode
;;;   Use the function call (ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle)
;;;   to change the setting after the first SAS-mode buffer has been created.
;;;   1c. You can also define C-TAB in all modes by Option 2b (below).
;;;
;;;   2. Managing submitted SAS jobs with function keys.
;;;   2a. Default: To define the function keys in ESS[SAS] mode only,
;;;   you will need, at most, one of the following two lines.
;;;(setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys t)  ;; F2-F12 bound in ESS[SAS] mode
;;;(setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)    ;; F2-F12 bound in ESS[SAS] mode
;;;
;;;   2b. Options: To define the function keys in all modes,
;;;   you will need, at most, one of the following two lines.
;;;(setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t) ;; F2-F12 bound in all modes
;;;(setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)   ;; F2-F12 bound in all modes
;;;
;;;   3. If it is more convenient to have "*Async Shell Command*"
;;;      in same-window-buffer-names, then:
;;;(ess-same-window-async)
;;;
;;;(defvar sas-program "sas" "*Name of program which runs sas.")
;;;
;;;(defvar sas-indent-width 4 "*Amount to indent sas statements")
