;;; There are extra complications in S+4 (compared to S+3) because
;;;
;;; (1) The StatSci supplied Splus.exe doesn't work in an emacs
;;;     buffer.  It works as as a GUI window and we must send commands
;;;     to it through ddeclient.  Nonetheless, we need to give it a
;;;     process name and be sure that that there is a valid running
;;;     process in the '(ddeESS [S+4])' buffer.  Therefore we create an
;;;     ESS process in the buffer as a placeholder and start a shell
;;;     in the ESS buffer.  From the shell we start Splus.  Once Splus
;;;     finishes initializing and kills the original shell, we start
;;;     another shell.  We have a buffer-local variable
;;;     inferior-ess-ddeclient, initialized to nil.  When there is a
;;;     non-nil value of inferior-ess-ddeclient we send lines to
;;;     inferior-ess-ddeclient rather than to the Splus process.
;;; (2) There is no Splus process running in the '(ddeESS [S+4])'
;;;     buffer.  Therefore inferior-ess will never see a prompt,
;;;     unless we first change it to the null prompt "^".  Then once
;;;     the process has started, we change it back.
;;; (3) When M-x S+4 starts Splus by a shell command, then Splus is an
;;;     independent process and will be survive if the '(ddeESS [S+4])'
;;;     buffer is killed (or emacs is quit).  The '(ddeESS [S+4])' is
;;;     made read-only and a warning is placed in it saying that "You
;;;     can't type anything here."  Actually, if the standalone Splus
;;;     is killed and the '(ddeESS [S+4])' is made writable (C-x C-q),
;;;     then '(ddeESS [S+4])' becomes a shell buffer.
;;;
