;; Without knowing how to tell R to use w3m from within Emacs, and after
;; switching to Konqueror's window for the millionth time, I wrote the
;; following function:

;; This emulates some of the functionality of RSiteSearch() and tests ok in
;; my system GNU Emacs 22.0.50.1 (i486-pc-linux-gnu, X toolkit, Xaw3d scroll
;; bars) of 2006-04-27 on pacem, modified by Debian.  This has the benefit of
;; displaying results with whatever you've told browse-url to use; in my
;; case, w3m with the emacs-w3m package.

;; My elisp skills are rather poor, so comments and suggestions for
;; improvement are welcome.
;; --
;; Seb


;; MM _FIXME_: This only works correctly for  Emacs 22.0.50 (alpha)
;;             for 21.x it has problems in the (completing-read-multiple .)
;;             at the end
