;;; Commentary:

;; Strictly for debugging and development.  usage is:
;;           xemacs -no-site-file -no-init-file -load ess-debug.el -f S4
;; (or similar!)
;;
;; The whole point of this file is to enable debugging from a vanilla
;; environment.  It probably isn't needed too much right now.

;;; Code:

(defun ess-add-path (path &rest options)
  "Add PATH to `load-path' if it exists under `default-load-path'
directories and it does not exist in `load-path'.

You can use following PATH styles:
        load-path relative: \"PATH/\"
                        (it is searched from `default-load-path')
        home directory relative: \"~/PATH/\" \"~USER/PATH/\"
        absolute path: \"/HOO/BAR/BAZ/\"

You can specify following OPTIONS:
        'all-paths      search from `load-path'
                        instead of `default-load-path'
        'append         add PATH to the last of `load-path'.

For ESS, ONLY use load-path, since Emacs doesn't have
default-load-path."

  (let ((rest load-path)
        p)
    (if (and (catch 'tag
               (while rest
                 (setq p (expand-file-name path (car rest)))
                 (if (file-directory-p p)
                     (throw 'tag p))
                 (setq rest (cdr rest))))
             (not (member p load-path)))
        (setq load-path
              (if (memq 'append options)
                  (append load-path (list p))
                (cons p load-path))))))
