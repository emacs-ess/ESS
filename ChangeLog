	chapters and sections to reflect newly added features
	(``Completion'', ``Developing with ESS'', ``ESS tracebug'', ``ESS
	developer'', ``ESS ElDoc'', ``IDO Comppletion'' and ``Evaluating
	Code'').

	First chapters are all about S and R, no special distinctions is
	necessary in the section names. ESS is defector 80% R, and docs
	are reflecting that.

2012-02-25  Vitalie Spinu  <spinuvit@gmail.com>

2011-05-03  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/unixlike.texi (Unix installation):
	* Makeconf (LISPDIR):
	Installing everything into site-lisp is sloppy; better to create
	an ess sub-directory and install there.

2011-04-26  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/help-sas.texi (ESS(SAS)--TAB key): removing all references
	to uncommenting ess-site.el code since we moved away from that
	several years ago, however, the vestiges still linger (OK, but
	isn't that what vestiges do?)

	(TAGS): Expand on documentation, thanks to feedback from Martin.

2009-03-05  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/newfeat.texi, doc/help-bugs.tex, doc/help-jags.texi:
	ESS[BUGS] and ESS[JAGS]: typing = now results in <-

2009-02-23  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* Makeconf: update LISPDIR, INFODIR, ETCDIR
	for XEmacs.  Use the modern default
	/usr/local/share/xemacs rather than the
	deprecated /usr/local/lib/xemacs.  Also,
	default to the site-packages subdirectory
	rather than xemacs-packages, this allows
	you more freedom to update the SUMO packages
	without touching your ESS installation and
	vice versa.

2009-01-23  ESS Maintainers <ESS-core@stat.math.ethz.ch>

  * Version 5.3.11 released.

2009-01-21  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* Makefile (all install clean distclean): @for
	loop throws away exit code, probably due to cd ..
	which always returns 0; @for no longer used

2009-01-13  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/windows.texi and doc/unixlike.texi
	(Installation): replace fake double quotes
	in examples with real double quotes

2009-01-12  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/Makefile, doc/ess.texi, doc/readme.texi,
	  doc/windows.texi, doc/unixlike.texi (Installation):
	new simplified installation instructions for Windows
	and Unix/Unix-like including Mac OS X (major changes
	now complete)

2009-01-07  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/Makefile (TEXISRC): add help-jags.texi to list

	* doc/help-jags.texi
	(ESS(JAGS)--Log files):
	the "log" of the run is now .jog (like BUGS which
	is .bog); .out created too many problems since the BOA
	output files have that extension as well
	(ESS(JAGS)--Model files):
	adding 2 new local variables:  ess-jags-burnin and
	ess-jags-update.  ESS[BUGS] has similar variables, but
	the modern defaults are an order of magnitude bigger, so
	it seemed like creating new variables was warranted

2008-12-17  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/windows.texi (Microsoft Windows installation):
	this file will replace the Windows portion of inst_tar.texi

2008-12-15  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/Makefile (install-other-docs): fixing yet another
	bug related to DOCDIR, was there no testing at all before
	foisting this on us?

2008-12-09  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* Makeconf and doc/Makefile (DOCDIR): belatedly document
	and defensively create

2008-12-03  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* Makeconf and doc/readme.texi (README re-organization):
	Add TOC for plaintext format only, requires re-defining MAKETXT
	accordingly.

2008-12-02  Rodney Sparapani  <rsparapa@mcw.edu>

	* doc/readme.texi and doc/Makefile (README re-organization):
	re-arrange so that installation information comes in the
	4/5th sections rather than much further down (7/8th); also
	massaged wording in the intro which no longer requires as much
	perl (which I never really understood since I don't speak perl;
	shall we stick to what we all know: e-lisp/make/texi/not perl/etc.)

2008-11-14  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

2004-12-31  Stephen Eglen  <stephen@gnu.org>

	* doc/inst_tar.texi (Unix installation): Remove note regarding GNU
	Make, as this is relevant only for developers, and so does not
	need to be in the user's guide [the shorter the installation
	instructions, the better!]

2002-08-07  Martin Maechler  <maechler@stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* VERSION:

	* lisp/Makefile, Makefile:

	* lisp/ess-cust.el:

	* info/ess.info-1:
	Updating info for new version

	* ANNOUNCE, doc/authors.texi, doc/getting.texi, doc/inst_cvs.texi, doc/newfeat.texi, doc/requires.texi, info/ess.info-1, info/ess.info, info/ess.info-2, info/ess.info-3, info/ess.info-4, README:
	docs:  I was trying to create a PDF version of ANNOUNCE with
	texi2dvi and dvipdf (is there a better way?).  And, certain
	functions like @email and @code betray unsightly behavior.
	I replaced @email with @uref:mailto and @code with @display.
	You may note that a better translation of @code would be
	@example, but @example misbehaves as well.  @display doesn't
	make a difference for info or HTML, but it does for PDF.
	However, there doesn't appear to be an alternative for the
	moment.  Another bug, is texi2html ignores the @enumerate
	argument (besides mishandling @macro statements).  Oh joy!

2002-08-05  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* ANNOUNCE, doc/announc.texi, doc/Makefile, doc/readme.texi, README, info/ess.info-1:
	docs:  some final minor changes to docs before release.  Also,
	attempted to address Martin's concern in doc/Makefile with
	respect to install.  Now, you can differentiate between
	making in the doc directory and installing elsewhere as the
	documentation indicates.  The target install has returned for
	info files only.

2002-08-02  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* doc/dir, doc/help-sas.texi, doc/Makefile, info/ess.info-1, info/ess.info, README, info/ess.info-2:
	info:  Rich's comment made me realize that we may also need
	to "install" the dir file.  So, I changed the Makefile to:
	$(INFODIR)/ess.info: $(TEXISRC)
		@echo "making Info documentation..."
		$(MAKEINFO) ess.texi
		$(INSTALL) ess.info* $(INFODIR)
		test -f $(INFODIR)/dir || $(INSTALL) dir $(INFODIR)
	I suppose that a more sophisticated approach could be taken,
	but this is probably good enough for now.  I believe that
	all issues that I was working on are now complete.  I'm going
	on vacation on 8/7 and then to JSM the following week, but I
	should have e-mail and internet access the whole time.  Did
	someone once say "Release early and release often"?

2002-08-01  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* info/dir:
	dir:  I discovered what the problem is with @direntry and
	GNU Emacs 21.  Apparently, the functionality differs
	between XEmacs and Emacs.  Under XEmacs, the @direntry
	has precedence over the dir file.  Emacs appears to be
	just the opposite.  So, I edited the dir file by hand.
	Not sure where this file comes from.  info/emacs does
	not create this file in a directory that doesn't
	already have one.  The file doesn't seem to be
	created by makeinfo and thats where the problem lies.
	There is no synchronization between @direntry and dir
	once dir has been created (however that happens).  The
	best solution at present is to keep the two in synch
	by hand.  Which really isn't that big of a deal since
	we are only talking about one line being identical in
	dir and ess.texi

	* doc/ess.texi, README:
	HTML docs:  a few tweaks to the texinfo to create a
	reasonable HTML table of contents

	* doc/ess.texi, README:
	doc bug:  I was testing out the info docs and I realized that
	the "Detailed Node List" and the actual nodes for Installation
	were different.  In this case, it would lead you to believe
	that there weren't any relevant topics in the Installation
	section because you see the "Detailed" list first, but there's
	nothing on it.  I suppose you could carefully check each "Detailed"
	vs. actual node combination, but that would be time-consuming and
	prone to failure.  And, I also realized that nobody would want a
	100 item list when they can drill-down from a 10 item list anyways.
	So, I was lazy and just commented out the entire "Detailed Node List".

	* ANNOUNCE, doc/Makefile, README, doc/announc.texi, doc/authors.texi, doc/credits.texi, doc/ess.texi, doc/help-sas.texi, doc/inst_tar.texi, doc/readme.texi, info/ess.info-1, info/ess.info, info/ess.info-2, info/ess.info-3, info/ess.info-4:
	more doc changes:  Where should I begin?  I realized that having info files might
	not be helpful if you didn't already have ESS installed.  So, I decided to
	create HTML docs and put them @ software.biostat.washington.edu:/ess/doc/html
	But, texi2html doesn't work with version.texi.  After pulling my hair out, I
	decided to read the documentation.  Guess what?  texi2html doesn't support
	@macro commands.  So, instead of @essver{}, I replaced those references by
	@include ../VERSION which seems to work.  Of course, this was after I re-did the
	doc/Makefile thinking there was something wrong in there.  The HTML docs are now
	on the net.  And, lots of other "improvements" to the docs.

	* doc/ess.texi, info/ess.info, README, info/ess.info-1, info/ess.info-2, info/ess.info-3, info/ess.info-4:
	info:  running some long SAS jobs, ZZZZZzzzzZZZZZ...
	Meanwhile, re-wrote parts of the intro and re-arranged some of the
	documentation categories; boy is that fun.  NOT!  Promoted "Help for
	the S family" and "Help for SAS" to main categories so you
	don't have to poke around so long.  One bugaboo that remains
	with GNU Emacs 21.1-21.3 is the @direntry which is set to:
	* ESS: (ess). Emacs Speaks Statistics (S/S+/R, SAS, BUGS, Stata, XLisp-Stat).
	but, Emacs sadly reports:  ESS Version 5.x.y (was: S-mode).
	This works fine on XEmacs 21.4.8 and I'm using texinfo 4.2

	* lisp/ess-utils.el:
	ess-kermit-get, ess-kermit-send
	I had to replace (shell) with ess-sas-goto-shell; maybe we should
	generalize ess-sas-goto-shell and ess-sas-shell-buffer in ess-utils.el too

	* Makeconf, README, doc/Makefile, info/ess.info-1, info/ess.info, info/ess.info-2, info/ess.info-3, info/ess.info-4, lisp/Makefile:
	more Makefile changes:  Apparently, we had two different methods for
	replacing old version numbers with new ones.  For some reason, the
	old method based on perl stopped working.  So, we created a new
	method based on @essver{}.  However, the old version targets and
	dependencies remained.  I have no idea what kind of weirdness
	resulted from that.  Just in case, I'm removing the old method.

	* doc/Makefile, fontlock-test/baseball.sas, Makeconf, Makefile, VERSION:
	Makefile happy-land:  I think I finally figured this maze out.
	We'll see when we try to release 5.1.21

	* lisp/ess-utils.el:
	ess-utils.el:  fixed a bug in ess-save-and-set-local-variables;
	more exhaustive testing later tonight

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]:  ess-save-and-set-local-variables is now called
	from ess-sas-submit-sh, ess-sas-submit-windows and
	ess-sas-submit-mac rather than save-buffer which formerly
	appeared in ess-sas-submit.  Not, sure what to do with
	ess-sas-submit-iESS, but it should not be called in
	ess-sas-submit-region.  Also, now called in
	ess-sas-data-view so you can take advantage of the
	recently added ess-sas-data-view-fsview-statement
	buffer-local variable.

	* lisp/ess-utils.el:
	ess-utils.el:  added 2 new functions

	ess-search-except:  searches forward for a regexp, stores as match 1
	and optionally, ignores results that also match a second regexp parameter,
	and optionally, searches backward for a third non-nil parameter

	ess-save-and-set-local-variables:  if a buffer is modified, save the
	buffer and if Local Variables are defined, update them with revert
	returning t if buffer was modified and nil otherwise

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS], ess-sas-data-view:  Now, I'm adding features just for myself.
	I've always wanted the capability to add a PROC FSVIEW statement to an
	ess-sas-data-view call, but I just never got around to it.  You can
	configure it with the string ess-sas-data-view-fsview-statement.  Also,
	you can now change the PROC FSVIEW command itself with
	ess-sas-data-view-fsview-command and I renamed ess-sas-data-view-options
	to ess-sas-data-view-submit-options to make it more clear what it does
	(i.e. so you don't confuse -options with -fsview-command).

	* Makeconf, doc/Makefile, info/ess.info-1, info/ess.info, info/ess.info-2, info/ess.info-3, Makefile, info/ess.info-4, lisp/Makefile:
	Makeconf/Makefile tweaking:  still need to re-organize doc
	Makefile which is currently in the main Makefile and the
	doc Makefile

2002-07-23  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* Makeconf:
	Makeconf:  minor improvements in anticipation of a more
	important role for this method of installing ESS

	* lisp/make-regexp.el:
	make-regexp.el:  timing functions removed due to name collisions with Gnus

2002-07-22  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]:  extended ess-sas-goto-shell to take an optional
	argument if non-nil, then set-buffer rather than switch.  This
	new call replaces code chunks in ess-sas-submit-region,
	ess-sas-data-view and ess-sas-graph-view.  Furthermore, this
	behavior is what was intended in nearly all
	(ess-sas-goto-shell) calls and I have replaced them all with
	(ess-sas-goto-shell t); except for the key-bindings for F8/F3
	and the code that deals with kermit file transfers which require
	the old behavior.  Have only tested on XEmacs and 'sh, so YMMV.

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]:  ess-sas-goto-shell resurrected!  Our recent discussion
	with respect to each SAS program, perhaps, needing it's own
	ess-sas-submit-method brought me back to ancient discussions
	of asynchronous shell buffer names.  Emacs and XEmacs named them
	differently.  Our solution was to use & for 'sh and start for 'ms-dos
	to make synchronous processes asynchronous.  However, this made
	ess-sas-goto-shell unnecessary since the buffer was always *shell*.

	Now, I added the variable ess-sas-shell-buffer which is buffer-local
	and defaults to *shell*.  If you set this to something else, then you
	will get another shell buffer.  And, ess-sas-goto-shell will take you
	to whichever one you need.  So, we are back to the original function.
	I also moved the add-hook call to the shell creation step since it
	seemed like over-kill to call it every time you did ess-sas-submit-sh.
	Is this enough explanation or am I boring you?

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]: moved ess-kermit- variables to ess-cust.el and
	ess-kermit- functions to ess-utils.el

	* lisp/ess-cust.el:
	ess-cust.el:  applied Stephen's patch; also changed more :types
	from "string" to 'string; finally, fixed custom-ize for SAS; it
	always worked if you specified 'ess-sas for the
	group, but never worked if you specified 'ess; this was because
	defgroup defined 'ess-SAS rather than 'ess-sas; and, now I understand
	what :prefix does; we discussed this previously and nobody knew
	(the documentation doesn't say either); :prefix is the beginning of
	the variable name that the custom-ize buffer doesn't show you;
	therefore, it seems that :prefix should be "ess-" for 'ess-sas;
	I think this is what it always was, but now I know this is right;
	only tested this on XEmacs 21.4.8 which is nearly bullet-proof;
	please test on buggier versions of (x)emacs

2002-07-11  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ess-search-except, ess-sas-data-view, ess-sas-graph-view:
	improvements to all; simplification of the latter -view's
	with ess-search-except and other minor changes

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ess-search-except:  I forgot to include the bloody example of it's
	use; now see ess-sas-data-view.

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ess-search-except:  I believe it does what we want now.  Sorry, to make this
	a multi-stage commit, but I can think in SAS, not elisp yet :o)

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ess-search-except:  I had some free time and I decided to
	write a function to perform the complex searches
	that are necessary for ess-sas-data-view.  I suppose a function
	like this would be valuable for ess-sas-graph-view and for
	other packages as well.  After a bit more testing, I'll put
	it some place more appropriate.  I suppose we don't
	have alot of time left before 5.2.0

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ess-sas-data-view:  the code will make your head hurt, but
	the search for a permanent SAS data just got a little smarter.
	After it finds a tentative candidate in a forward search,
	it checks if it is a work./first./last.  If so, then it
	backward searches.  I suppose a better approach would be
	to write an ess-search function that takes arguments
	for regexp, direction, and exceptions to ignore.  I
	don't have time right now, but let's add it to the TODO.

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ess-sas-data-view:  Now ignoring WORK datasets since there is no

	ess-sas-graph-view) could also be accessable via the mouse.
	Any hints as to how to do it would be appreciated.  Currently, you have
	to move the point manually or re-type the dataset/graph that you want
	to view.  Just clicking on a dataset/graph would be easier.

	when ess-sas-goto is passed the suffix "log" or "lst" ess-kermit-get
	is called if the file starts with ess-kermit-prefix; other extensions
	could be dangerous since you might have altered the local copy whereas
	.log and .lst files are only being modified by the SAS batch job; as
	long as the integrity of the .sas program is maintained .log and .lst
	can always be retrieved if an unwanted transfer overwrites them

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]: ess-kermit-send
	incorporated into ess-sas-submit-sh  kermit is almost as transparent as
	tramp and ange-ftp/EFS  just execute ess-sas-submit like any other file

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]:  ess-sas-submit-sh now works with local copies of kermit transfer files.  just need some documentation.

2002-05-03  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]: ess-kermit-send now works although I haven't tested
	it completely.  still need to fix ess-sas-submit-sh

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]:  updated ess-kermit-get per the latest proposal;
	created a variable ess-kermit-prefix which is
	customize-able that can be used to specify the files that
	are recognized as local kermit copies of remote files.
	: is the default and the only other value that is
	recommended is ]  also, created ess-kermit-remote-directory
	which is buffer local and the default is customize-able;
	currently $HOME  when you run ess-kermit-get you can
	reset this variable and ess-kermit-get is now documented
	haven't fixed ess-kermit-send, but it should be trivial
	also note, that if you have just done an ess-kermit-send
	then ess-sas-submit-sh should work as long as we handle the
	cd command appropriately, i.e. "cd ."

2002-05-02  rmh  <rmh@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/essd-els.el:
	change SAS to SAS-customize-alist

	* lisp/essd-els.el:
	add &optional proc-name to ess-remote

2002-05-01  rmh  <rmh@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/essd-els.el: ess-remote

	First draft of what I consider the right way to do what we
	have previously called S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere.

	Please test this.  Start a telnet or other protocol to a remote computer,
	start S or R (or maybe something else), M-x ess-remote, and tell it which
	dialect.  You are now talking to an inferior-ess process.

	I added all the *-customize-alist to ess-select-alist-dialect.  I added
	only sp6 to the dialects we prompt for, but all will be recognized.

	Rodney, dialect "sas" points to S+elsewhere-customize-alist rather than
	to SAS-customize-alist.

	If this works then ess-add-ess-process should be moved from essa-sas.el to
	ess-inf.el

	* lisp/essdsp6w.el, lisp/ess-site.el:
	tweaks to S+6 for S-Plus 6.1 for Windows beta 1

	Delay time is now a user variable ess-S+6-startup-delay.
	No delay time for S+6-existing.
	We verify the version of S-Plus 6 and hide and make read-only the file we check.
	ESS now prompts for the correct directory.

2002-04-29  rmh  <rmh@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/essdsp6w.el:
	S-Plus 6.1 beta for Windows works correctly with ESS.
	6.0 didn't work correctly.

	I modified M-x S+6 to
	  "Verify that `inferior-S+6-program-name' points to S-Plus 6.
	Start normally for S-Plus 6.1.  Inform the user to start S-Plus 6.0
	from the icon and than connect to it with `S+6-existing'.  Give an error
	message if `inferior-S+6-program-name' doesn't point to S-Plus 6."


	S-Plus 6.1 starts up exceedingly slowly.  I changed the delay time in
	M-x S+6-initiate to 60 seconds (double what we needed for M-x S+4).
	The is the delay needed for my 300MHz machine.  I will make this a
	variable so the users can customize it for their speed.

	we don't want the semantic stuff "live" yet!

	* lisp/essd-r.el, lisp/r.bnf, lisp/sas.bnf, lisp/semantic-r.el, lisp/semantic-sas.el:
	These files are the start of semantic.el support.  Useful for using the CEDET tools (cedet.sourceforge.net), including ECB.  Definitely worth a bit of time, but they get awfully confusing.

	* doc/ess.info-4, doc/Makefile:
	we now have ess.info-4

	* doc/ess.info-1, doc/ess.info, doc/ess.info-2, doc/ess.info-3, doc/ess.texi, doc/help-sas.texi, doc/help-s.texi, doc/inst_tar.texi, doc/Makefile:
	I fixed up help-sas, installed help-s, fixed up some style issues, cleaned up
	cross references to empty pages.

	All occurences of @essver MUST have braces @essver{} or else the remainder
	of the source line is treated as a comment.

	The doc/Makefile doesn't depend on the *.texi files.
	I attempted to change it to
	$(ESSINFODIR)/ess.info: *.texi
	but that doesn't work.  So I used
	$(ESSINFODIR)/ess.info: ess.texi help-sas.texi inst_tar.texi

	The @display requires everything to be left justified.  Otherwise the
	indentations are interpreted as hard spaces.

	Why are some lines in @display and others in @example?  They look the same.
	This is inst_tar.texi, lines 29-36
	@example
		gunzip ess-@essver{}.tar.gz
		tar vxf ess-@essver{}.tar
	@end example
	@display
		(or: @code{gunzip < ess-@essver{}.tar.gz | tar vxf -} ).
		(or using GNU tar:  @code{tar zvxf ess-@essver{}.tar.gz}).
	@end display

	I added the control-function keys to help-sas.texi

	I fixed the help menu pointers to the empty operating system nodes.

	As long as I am doing info, I fixed up help-s.texi and installed it.
	It compiles correctly.  It still needs to be read carefully to make sure
	it is coherent.


	I think the various doc/README* files now need to be regenerated
	from the appropriate *.texi files.

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:

	* doc/announc.texi, doc/ess.info-1, doc/ess.info, doc/ess.info-2, doc/ess.info-3, doc/ess.texi, doc/help-s.texi:
	doc: first attempt at creating user manual with texinfo.  I thought that I could
	just mimic help-s.texi.  However, help-s.texi appears to be a basket case.
	It has no @menu statements.  This made it impossible for me to makeinfo.  So,
	instead I created help-sas.texi from scratch based on README.SAS.  Note that
	the @menu commands will cause problems if they contain : so I've been using --.
	Also note that makeinfo appears to create working info pages, but texi2dvi
	does not create documents correctly.  It's a shame since they are very nice,
	except for garbage which appears to be mangled next, previous, and up.  This will
	cause us alot of problems if we want to maintain
	one source and produce .info, .html and .pdf (I actually only tried viewing
	with xdvi, but I suspect the problem exists with other formats, but I pray not).

2002-02-27  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]: GSASFILE viewing for Emacs 21.1; I figured out how to view
	image files in Emacs 21.1.  But, apparently it only works for Unix at
	the moment.  You have to turn on the minor mode auto-image-file-mode.
	Then opening a .jpg or .jpeg file will display it in a buffer.  It is
	supposed to work with .gif files, but it doesn't for me; so I'm only
	activating this feature for JPEG.

2002-02-26  rsparapa  <rsparapa@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/ess-emcs.el:
	lisp(ess-emcs.el):  added a function to display graphical images
	per the XEmacs documentation (for 21.4 and higher)

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]: viewing GSASFILEs; XEmacs supports .gif and .jpg natively.
	So, on XEmacs, those formats are displayed in an empty buffer.  Otherwise,
	graphics are handled as before (with an image viewer program).

2002-02-26  rmh  <rmh@lynne.stat.math.ethz.ch>

	* lisp/ess-iw32.el:
	The repair of the C-c C-l problem reported by S.McClatchie
	<s.mcclatchie@niwa.cri.nz> and Bj©Ìrn-Helge Mevik <bhm@math.uio.no>
	required a change to ess-command in ess-iw32.el.  I believe the problem
	was limited to Windows machines and first appeared in 5.1.19 when I added
	ess-command to ess-iw32.el.

	The temporary buffer buf was not associated with an ESS process.  Now it is.

	This is a consequence of how I created a windows version of
	ess-command.  Part of loading a file is checking whether the new file
	would overwrite any old S language objects.  This in turn requires
	running search() which uses ess-command.  The temporary buffer created
	to hold the results of the search was not associated with an ESS
	process.  Therefore when ess-command checks whether it is running
	under Windows, it finds instead that it is in the tbuffer which is not
	connected with an ESS process so it can't decide and quits.  Since the
	original buffer that the user was trying to load was correctly
	connected to an ESS process, the user is justifiably confused.

	The repair is done at the most central point, at the ess-command for
	windows.

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]: added a missing F11 key definition and new functionality
	for F12; pressing F12 searches for a GSASFILE definition, otherwise
	defaults to SAS program name and opens the image file in an image viewer
	application available on that OS (defaults to the CDE sdtimage for Unix
	and kodakimg for MS)

	First of all, zip will update a .zip if it already

	before overwriting a .gz.  So, I just delete the files if they already exist
	with a test && rm || true.  Also, tar would occasionally give me an error about
	symbolic links.  So, I did a mv instead of an ln -s.

	* lisp/essl-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]:  mult-line comments of the /* */ variety are always
	fontified correctly because they are handled by grammar rather
	than regular expressions.  OTOH, * ; and %* ; comments have only
	worked in the past on single line comments.  This is particularly
	annoying in SAS-log-mode since a single-line comment will often
	be flowed and not fontified correctly.  There is no solution TIKO
	for the multiple line problem so I changed the regular expression
	to just fontify the first line which will at least allow you to
	recognize that a comment is beginning which is better than the
	way it was before.

	* lisp/essl-sas.el:
	ESS[SAS]: improved macro statements syntax highlighting, i.e.
	you have more freedom of placement than you do for SAS
	statements in general

	2. There is a weird error in this version that I don't understand.
	The environment variable PATH gets the value of MANPATH.
	I cannot figure out why.  It is MANPATH for me on two machines so far,
	I don't know if that is related to my personal list of environment

	* doc/ess.info-1, doc/ess.texi, doc/inst_tar.texi, doc/newfeat.texi, lisp/ess-site.el:
	1. In ess-site.el section 2.1 I made two changes.
	For the	item a I want an opinion.

	a. I changed the default in this section from S-Plus 4,5,3
	   to S-Plus 6 for all three of those operating systems?
	   Is there still a need to distinguish linux from other unixen?

	b. I added (fset 'Sqpe 'Sqpe+6) for Windows


	2. I edited inst_tar.texi to match.


	3. While in inst_tar.texi I added to the SAS discussion and
	   fixed up the installation section to xref the Unix and MS sections
	   to each other.


	4. The current ess.texi and ess.info-2 have only the
	   unix information. I deleted the whole installation section
	   from ess.texi and replaced it with @include inst_cvs.texi


	5. Tony, please fix up inst_cvs.texi once the anonymous cvs server in
	   washington is working.


	6. Rodney, please put Macintosh instructions into inst_cvs.texi.


	7. I promised Terry Therneau that I would comment on indentation and
	   fancy comments in the *info*.  I did so in ess.texi.  While there I
	   added Rodney to the author list.


	8.  I added the STERM discussion to ess.texi.


	9.  I started to add the pager and editor discussion to ess.texi
	    and realized that I can't until the "@node Edit buffer" section is
	    completely rewritten.  I may do this, but not tonight.

	    This entire section describes the behavior pattern that we do not
	    encourage.  It describes the "S objects are real" philosophy deprecated
	    in the README.S file.

	    The revision can leave that in, but must have a section based on
	    the "Source code is real" philosophy.

	* lisp/ess-cust.el, lisp/essd-els.el, lisp/essd-r.el, lisp/essd-s3.el, lisp/essd-s4.el, lisp/essd-sp3.el, lisp/essd-sp4.el, lisp/essd-sp5.el, lisp/essd-sp6.el, lisp/essdsp6w.el:
	I installed options("STERM") in the rest of the S language essd*.el files.
	I documented it in ess.texi and in newfeat.texi.
	STERM has the value "iESS" for all except S+4 and S+6 for Windows.
	In those two situations it has value "ddeESS".  Suggestions for non-ESS
	values are in the ess.texi.


	I also installed options("editor") and options("pager").
	Default definitions are in ess-cust.el
	           Windows      Unix           Macintosh
	R-pager    nil          nil            nil

	S-pager    gnuclientw   emacsclient    nil
	S-editor   gnuclient    emacsclient    nil
	When the ESS value is nil, then nothing gets sent to the S language process.

	           c. moved R-mode to follow R
	essd-s3    a. I changed two
	                 (setq-default ess-customize-alist S3-customize-alist)
	              to use setq.

	essd-els  I made it match, but it needs rethinking.
	          The right plan is something along the lines of

	          b. start remote ess process,
	          c. `ess-add-ess-process'

	doing in the middle of `ess-command' in ess-inf.el?

	Rodney, please look at the
	    cvs log ess-mous.el
	There are several questions and comments about ess-processes
	in the Jan 14 log that overlap what you are doing in essa-sas.el


	essa-sas.el:

	I finally understand why we have been having trouble communicating
	about S+elsewhere.  `ess-add-ess-process' is a much simpler functional
	equivalent to the kludge in `S+elsewhere' and `ESS-elsewhere'.

	I revised the doc-string to make it more accurate and also simplified
	the function while I was there.


	ess-mous.el:
	I got rid of the end-of-line-problem I was having.

	* lisp/essa-sas.el, lisp/essl-sas.el:
	The ess-sas-toggle-log-sas-mode I posted yesterday didn't quite work.
	It go hung because the log and LOG options stepped on each other's
	toes.  So I put it all into a single if statement, renamed it to
	ess-sas-toggle-sas-log-mode, made it refer to SAS-log-mode, and
	redefined SAS-log-mode to agree with current usage.

	* lisp/essa-sas.el:
	I finally read the latest essa-sas.el

	1. I found ess-sas-toggle-sas-mode several months ago and started to use it.
	I like it.  Now that I have read it closely I revised it and renamed it.
	;;; this version of ess-sas-toggle-log-sas-mode
	;;; 1. can be included in .emacs as
	;;;           (ess-sas-toggle-log-sas-mode t)
	;;;    because it doesn't need to find a .log file.
	;;; 2. works if there is already an association for .log files.
	;;; 3. restores the old association when SAS-mode is deleted.
	;;; 4. works with the file it has, doesn't kill it and get a fresh copy.
	;;;    This matters for large log files and slow telephone connections.
	;;; 5. I changed its name to be more descriptive.


	2. How is kermit used by ESS?

	I see definititions for ess-kermit-command ess-kermit-get ess-kermit-send,
	but do not see any places they are used.

	I think these three items should be separated into a new ess-kermit.el
	rather than buried in essa-sas.el.  Are they restricted to ess in any way?
	Might they be better as a new kermit.el?


	3. You hardwired the `txt' extension into ess-sas-file-path.  That should
	be sensitive to the value of ess-sas-suffix-1 and ess-sas-suffix-2.


	4. ess-sas-submit-mac is the only ess-sas-submit* that does not have
	ess-sas-submit-command-options.  I don't understand
	ess-sas-submit-command-options.  Why is it buffer-local?  I think it
	should depend on the host and the version of sas, not on the
	myfile.sas command file.  Am I misunderstanding what is going on?


	5. ess-revert-wisely in essa-sas.el and ess-revert in essl-bug.el are identical.
	This suggests that the ess-revert name should be used and moved to ess-utils.el

	* lisp/ChangeLog, lisp/ess-inf.el, lisp/ess-mode.el, lisp/ess-mous.el, lisp/ess-trns.el:
	ess-mous is ready for testing.

	ess-mous.el: put ess-mous on submenu of C-mouse-3 for
	             ess-transript-mode, inferior-ess-mode, ess-mode
	             This feature is still beta.

	ess-inf.el:
	  ess-ddeclient-p. now depends on ess-local-process-name
	  get-ess-process. I changed error message to say buffer is not
	                   associated with an ESS process (instead of
	                   saying that no ESS process is running)
	  inferior-ess-mode-menu.  Added "What is this? (beta)"

	ess-trns.el:
	  ess-transcript-mode-menu.  Added "What is this? (beta)"

	ess-mode.el:
	  ess-mode-menu.  Added "What is this? (beta)"

	ChangeLog: ess-mous changes.

	I tested it on windows for R, S+4, and Sqpe+4.
	I am having line-ending problems with Sqpe+4 but otherwise it looks ok.
	Please look at it.


	I found a problem which I am unsure how to solve.  The variable
	`ess-current-process-name' in the `*R*' buffer can have the value
	"S+4".  All I have to do is open an S+4 process and an R process, then
	C-c C-s the file.s buffer to S+4 and then switch to the R process.

	I think, but am willing to hear arguments against it, that anytime an
	inferior-ess-mode buffer is made current, then it should automatically
	reset `ess-current-process-name' to refer to itself.  I'm not sure how
	to do that.  This is explicitly not a buffer-local variable.  Is there
	a hook that gets called when we change into a buffer, either by C-x b
	or by clicking?

	  (S-after-pathname-p): deleted
	  (S-complete-filename): New function

Fri Feb 18 19:27:10 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-check-modifications): Don't cause an error
	  if the source file has been deleted.

Tue Feb 15 12:11:42 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-temp-buffer-p): Deleted. There is no longer
	  any dependence on this variable: S-local-process-name suffices.
	(S-local-variables-string): Deleted. File extensions should be
	good enough for setting the mode.
	(S-cleanup): Simplified. Doesn't delete files.

	* splitup2/S-help.el (S-help-mode): Make S-local-process-name
	  local.

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-mode): make S-local-process-name
	  permanent-local.
	  (S-insert-function-templates): deleted, S-function-template has

	  (S-function-template): May be nil or a string. Point is placed
	  after first open.

	  (S-dump-object-into-edit-buffer): If S-keep-dump-files is nil,
	  don't delete files, but don't make backups either.

Mon Feb 14 14:53:17 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-check-modifications): New function
	(S-load-file): Rewrite. Only ask for a filename if the current
	buffer is not in S-mode. Always offer to save.

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-inf-filenames-map): New variable

	* splitup2/S-mode.el (S-mode): Set parse-sexp-ignore-comments to
	  t; there are no longer any limitations with this in elisp.

Wed Feb	 9 13:25:12 1994  David M. Smith  (maa036@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* splitup2/S-trans.el (S-transcript-send-command-and-move): New
	  function

	  (S-transcript-send-command): Doesn't move any more.

	* splitup2/S-inf.el (S-eval-visibly): Call
	  comint-output-filter-functions

Wed Jan 26 11:15:46 1994  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* S.el	(S-search-list): Caches result in S-search-list <v>
	(S-execute-objects): Use it
	(S-search-list <v>): Now just a cache. Don't access directly
	Completions are now calculated on demand; as a result the first
	completion in a session will take a long time. The results are
	cached, however, so remaining completions should be fast.

Sun Jan 23 17:56:46 1994  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* S.el (S): If S-ask-for-S-directory is unset, set
	  default-directory to S-directory.

Wed Jan 19 16:16:10 1994  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun5.lancs.ac.uk)

	* S-site.el: Added (cond (window-system ...)) calls so that all
	  users (even those without window systems) can safely require
	  this file.

Thu Jan	 6 15:15:53 1994  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	Version 4.1alpha released to wingra
	* S.el: deleted S-set-display and associated variables.

Fri Dec 24 11:56:00 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-command): Rewrite. Now uses a new filter to redirect
	  output to the buffer; comint never sees the output. This filter
	  could feasibly be accomodated to detect the prompt itself;
	  allowing for an "in the background" implementation of S-command.

	  (S-process-sentinel): Reports date; useful if you have run many
	  S sessions in one transcript file.

Thu Dec 16 12:47:38 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-multi): Ask for transcript file, maybe
	(S-ask-about-transfile): new variable
	(S-get-directory): replaces S-set-directory

Wed Dec 15 12:10:11 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-loop-timeout): Increased

Mon Dec 13 10:11:25 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-command): Avoids calling comint-output-filter-functions
	  until the last minute.
	  (S-complete-object-name): Complete rewrite of completion
	  routines. Completion should now be accurate in every situation:
	  the only way to make it wrong is to use assign() to assign into
	  a dataframe not at position 1. Uses objects() to make listings,
	  so you don't get .Data, .Help etc. Should now be able to make
	  this work for DOS users.
	(S-object-list): New buffer-local vbl; cache of completions

Thu Dec	 9 12:08:09 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-process-sentinel): Can now see message after q()

Tue Nov 16 09:25:41 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-mode): kill-all-local-variables
	(S-insert-local-variables): Use ### instead of # in local
	variables section.

Mon Nov 15 10:31:02 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-mode): Changed
	  comint-after-partial-pathname-command to
	  comint-after-partial-filename-command (new comint)

Sun Nov 14 17:18:55 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el: Version 4.00alpha. Made available for FTP, and
	  announced on the S-mode mailing list

Fri Nov 12 12:36:06 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-transcript-mode): Created.
	(S-execute-screen-options): Added.

Thu Nov 11 12:30:06 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-find-help-file): More intuitive defaults when requesting
	  help generated by S-read-helpobj-name-default.

	  (S-eval-visibly): Doesn't wait for prompt after the last line of
	  text has been sent.

	  (inferior-S-send-input): Big improvement in the handling of
	  multi-line inputs. Users should use LFD (not RET) to continue
	  incomplete commands. Should automate this.

Thu Oct	 7 14:45:00 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-mode): Few mods to make it work with the new
	  comint.

Mon Sep 27 11:21:56 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-get-old-input): Now separates multi-line
	  commands by newlines instead of spaces. This produces messier
	  output, but avoids S's 255 char line limit for commands.

Sun Sep 26 17:38:59 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-kill-buffer-function): Added to kill-buffer-hook in the
	  process buffer.

Fri Sep 17 11:23:36 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-display-temp-buffer): Uses temp-buffer-show-function
	  instead of popper.

	  (inferior-S-mode): Fixed a typo of paragraph-separate appearing
	  as paragraph-start.

Wed Sep 15 11:47:51 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el: Converted old E18 variables (buffer-flush-undo,
	  comment-indent-hook) to E19 versions. Removed the require for
	  comint-extra -- now contained in the new comint.el. Removed
	  autoload for comint-isearch -- that's the user's decision.
	(inferior-S-prompt): Now generated from inferior-S-primary-prompt
	  and (new variable) inferior-S-secondary-prompt

Tue Sep 14 09:33:03 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-multi): Makes use of Simon Marshall's new comint.el. New
	  variable S-history-file for saving histories. Calls
	  comint-read-input-ring. Sets the sentinel.
	(S-process-sentinel): Created. Automatically saves the history
	  ring if the S process dies.

Sun Sep 12 18:53:40 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el: (S-multi). Now always switches to the buffer associated
	  with process N, if available.

	(inferior-S-make-comint): New calling procedure; bufname is the
	  literal buffer name (no *'s are added); procname is the process
	  name to use.

Tue Sep	 7 16:20:11 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-mode-map): Unbound comint-[mp]search input, and
	comint-isearch, as I haven't tested them yet.
	(inferior-S-mode): replaced input-ring-size with
	comint-input-ring-size (Vivek Khera <khera@cs.duke.edu>).

	* comint-extra.el: Added comint-msearch* and comint-psearch*,
	commented out in the E19 distribution of comint.el

	* comint-isearch.el: Back in the distribution

Fri Sep	 3 16:20:28 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (S-mode): Replaced the documentation string, and removed
	the code which set it explicitly. Doing this was breaking the byte
	compiler. Version 3.63

Wed Aug 25 17:36:57 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam.maths.adelaide.edu.au)

	* S.el (inferior-S-send-input): Added a hook: S-send-input-hook,
	so that I could do nice things with highlighting. This will
	probably disappear or change.

Sat Aug 14 14:48:11 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam)

	* S.el (S-extract-onames-from-alist): Modified so that
	S-complete-object-name will work in the minibuffer (e.g. through
	command S-execute.)

	* S.el: Restructured the entire S.el file into meaningful
	sections. The file now uses Outline mode.

	* S.el: Tek mode is no longer supported. Moved all Tek-related
	variables and functions to S-tek.el, and commented out any code
	references to them.

	* S-tek.el: This file is no longer supported. Moved all
	Tek-related functions and variables in S.el to the end of this
	file.

Wed Aug	 4 16:35:24 1993  David Smith  (dsmith@spam)

	* S.el (S-complete-object-name): Fixed regexp so that completion
	over lists works properly.

Thu Jul 22 12:25:46 1993  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun4)

	* S.el: Uses s-menu instead of s-simple-menus.

	* s-menu.el: Totally rehacked from s-simple-menus.el to use
	easymenu.el, to take advantage of Emacs 19 menus.

	* S.el: Rehacked the multiple process code so that local variables
	are used to store process-specific variables. I really don't know
	why I didn't do this in the first place. As a result multiple
	processes actually seem to work, now.
	(S-request-a-process): Now enters initial input

Sun Jul 18 12:15:27 1993  David Smith  (maa507@mathssun4)

	* S.el: Created this change log file, and moved the change log
	from S.el here.

The following is from the original Changelog section of S.el

  Release 2.1 on October 14, 1991 to statlib@stat.cmu.edu,
     and to the elisp archives at OSU (brennan@dg-rtp.dg.com (Dave Brennan))
  and announced on internet.s-news, netnews.gnu.emacs.sources, &
    andrew.programs.S
 -------------------------------------------------------
     Jul 26	     1991  Frank Ritter
   * added S-mode-load-hook & S-pre-run-hook
     and testing by neilc@research.att.com
     Jul 9	     1991  Frank Ritter
   * Changed S-command to use a register rather than
       the kill ring.
   * Better file header, comments now at 60 col so
       mailers wont' eat them.
   * Better S-extract-word-name.
   * Added S-mode-version variable
   * Changed syntax table to read |#; appropriately

 Wed Nov 28 11:03:50 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)
   * Make the S-mode-syntax-table a slightly modified
       version of the c-mode-syntax-table instead of a
       version of the one for lisp.

 Sat Nov 10 12:41:52 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)
   * Made run-S and run-s commands synonymous with the
       function S.

 Fri Oct 19 12:41:52 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)

       run from that directory.

 Thu Oct 18 12:41:52 1990  Ed Kademan  (kademan at hermes)
   * Added function S-nuke-help-bs to clean up nroff
       style text in the S help buffer.	 This function is
       a modification of nuke-nroff-bs from man.el.
 -------------------------------------------------------
 Unnumbered version released dated Thu Jun 14 09:56:56 CDT 1990

 Fri Jan 17 1992 Dave Smith (dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au)
   * Help mode for reading files. When asking for an object to
     run help on, completion is over those help files that exist.
   * Added object name completion, and made S-get-object-list
     efficient enough to make it worthwile.
   * Error parsing for loaded files
   * Better customization of file-names, with sensible defaults
   * Sensible buffer names for object buffers
   * Corrected definition for `.' in syntax table
   * Improved (and simplified) S-read-object-name-default
   * Included pager='cat' to default help-command specification
   * Added a call to run-hook for S-pre-run-hook
   * Changed keymaps to conform with GNU guidelines
     (i.e. no \C-letter bindings)
   * S-command has a new third argument, visible

 Tue May 27 1992 Dave Smith (dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au)
   * now copes with dynamically changing prompts (reported by Doug Bates)

 Thu May 29 1992 Dave Smith (dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au)
   * Added S-execute, modified S-execute-* to use it.

 Mon Jun 22 1992 dsmith
   * Added S-mode editing commands written by Ken'ichi Shibayama
     (shiba@isac.co.jp). A big win.
   * Removed the redundant argument to S-switch-to-end-of-S
   * S-function-pattern improved
   * added S-eval-visibly, S-eval-visibly-p and modified S-eval-*
     to use them
   * added S-eval-line-and-next-line
   * eval commands can now echo in the process buffer
   * added S-kill-output and S-view-at-bottom
   * added a binding for comint-isearch and autoloaded it
   * added S-execute-in-tb. S-parse-errors now takes prefix arg.

 Thu Jun 25 1992 dsmith
   * Moved some doctrings to comments (Frank Ritter)
   * The Tek stuff now lives in a separate file (Frank Ritter)
   * Fiddly C-c ESC M-. bindings in S mode and Help mode moved
       to C-c M-. bindings (Martin Maechler)
   * S-execute-objects now uses variable inferior-S-objects-command
       whose value depends on S version. (Ken'ichi Shibayama)
   * Symbols given uniform prefixes: S- or inferior-S- (Frank Ritter)

 -- Version 3.41 released to Statlib and Emacs Archive --

 Tue Jul  7 11:56:59 CST 1992 dsmith
   * S-execute-attach now updates the internal search list. This
     is a manifestation of a general bug: S-command doesn't call
     S-search-path-tracker

 Wed Jul 29 09:38:54 CST 1992 kenichi
   * Several fixes to indenting code. New variable S-else-offset.
     Indentation of code not within braces. expression() indentation.
     Correct handling of in-line comments.

 Fri Aug  7 10:52:06 CST 1992 dsmith
   * S-execute now uses S-mode-minibuffer-map.
   * Setting indentation variables in .emacs now has some effect.
   * Files retrieved by S-dump-object-into-scratch are now automatically
     placed in S-mode.

 Fri Jul 28 1992 R.D.Ball
   added multi-S to allow multiple S sessions
   run by ESC-x S or with numeric prefix arg e.g. ESC-2 ESC-x S
   The current S process is determined by S-process-name,
   this is modified by typing a return into a non-current S process
   buffer.
   Variables S-process-name-list, S-current-process-name
   and functions update-S-process-name-list, get-S-process to
   replace (get-process "*S*"), and checks for existence of process,
   buffer in inferior-S-mode

   made function S-eval-line-and-next-line keep to the bottom of
   the S process buffer so user can see results when working interactiveley
   To do this an optional arg eob was added to S-eval-visibly
   To go to bottom of window it was necessary to use
   switch-to-buffer-other-window, but this only when eob is t.
   Additionally, if S-eval-visibly-at-end is t the functions
   S-eval-region etc. also display results at the end of the
   current process buffer.

   Default directory for starting S is now the current directory
   for the current buffer. (Set S-use-current-directory to nil to
   avoid this).


 Sat Sep 19 18:35:10 CST 1992 dmsith

   * Modified Rod's multi-S code so that it works properly.
     S-process-name-list is now an alist whose CARs are the process
     names and whose CDRs is an alist of variable . value pairs
     specific to particular processes (so e.g. completion works
     properly for each buffer.) The function
     S-get-process-specific-vbls does the work, and any
     process-specific variables should be mentioned here.
     S-mode buffers know which process they should evaluate into.

   * New command S-request-a-process which should be bound to a key.

 Wed Nov  4 dsmith
   * S-load-file now informs you if S gave a warning during load.
     Also, the S-errors buffer is displayed using popper, if available
   * C-x ` is now also bound in S-mode.
   * Installed Frank's menus

 Wed Nov 18 dsmith
   * Bound M-TAB and M-? to comint completion functions in inf-S-mode
     and S-mode
   * In the process buffer, a paragraph is a promwpt, a command and its
     output, to make the paragraph functions useful
   * Multiple S sessions in a process buffer are delimited by ^L, to
     make the page functions useful
   * In process buffer mode line, name of process is shown in [..]
     (in case buffer name is changed.) In edit buffers, the name
     if the process the buffer belongs to is shown in []'s

 Wed Nov 21 dsmith
   * Nuked S-make-function, since it is now obsolete
   * Added S-clean-region
   * M-TAB in S-mode now completes *files*, not objects. Object
     completion has moved to C-c TAB.
   * Bound k in the help buffer to 'kill-buffer.
   * Local variables are added to files accessed with C-c C-d, if needed.
   * Fixed incorrect use of 'save-buffer in several places.
   * Bound C-c C-p to 'S-request-a-process
   * Replaced S-beginning-of-function and S-end-of-function to DMS's
     versions, since Frank's don't work with the new function regexp.
