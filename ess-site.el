;;; Commentary:

;; This file defines all the site-specific customizations for ESS.  It should be
;; edited on a per-site basis.  Read the comments (1.1 in Section 1 to see if
;; ess-site.el must be edited.  The final directory location of this file must be
;; supplied in ess-lisp-directory.  The editing of remaining sections is
;; optional.  It should then be byte-compiled, and users who wish to use ESS
;; should add the path to ess-site to their `load-path' and require it:
;;
;;    (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ess/lisp-directory");;
;;    (require 'ess-site)

;;; Code:

;;;; Load path, autoloads, and major modes
;;;; ========================================
;;
;; For most users the variable ess-lisp-directory will automatically
;; be set correctly.  If you are working with an old emacs, one in
;; which file-truename is not defined, then you might need to change
;; the value of ess-lisp-directory to the directory which is to
;; contain the file ess-site.elc.  This is probably the current
;; directory, or the value of LISPDIR if it was set in the Makefile.

;; DEBUG: (setq ess-show-load-messages t); instead of nil above

;; This sets `ess-lisp-directory' either from the current directory
;; when the file is being `load'ed, or from the installed location
;; otherwise. This way, users can load ESS without having added ESS to
;; `load-path'.
(defvar ess-lisp-directory
  ;; A nice default
  (directory-file-name
   (file-name-directory
    (if load-file-name
        (file-truename load-file-name)
      (locate-library "ess-site") )))
  "Directory containing ess-site.el(c) and other ESS Lisp files.")

(defvar ess-etc-directory nil
  "Location of the ESS etc/ directory.
The ESS etc directory stores various auxillary files that are useful
for ESS, such as icons.")


;; Depending on how ESS is loaded the `load-path' might not contain
;; the `lisp' directory. For this reason we need to add it before we
;; start requiring ESS files
(add-to-list 'load-path (file-name-as-directory ess-lisp-directory))
;; Add ess-lisp-directory/obsolete to load-path; files here will
;; automatically warn that they are obsolete when loaded.
(add-to-list 'load-path (file-name-as-directory (expand-file-name "obsolete" ess-lisp-directory)))
