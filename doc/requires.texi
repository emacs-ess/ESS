ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata, OpenBUGS and JAGS.

ESS supports current, and recent, stable versions of GNU Emacs
(currently, 24.3 or higher; alpha/beta/pre-release versions are NOT SUPPORTED).  

Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS
support of XEmacs ended with ESS 12.04-4.

To build the PDF documentation, you will need a version of TeX Live or
texinfo that includes texi2dvi (BEWARE: recent TeX Live, and some
texinfo RPMs, do NOT include texi2dvi).
