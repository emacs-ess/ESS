   <blockquote>
Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with
SAS, S-PLUS, R, BUGS/JAGS and other statistical analysis packages under
the Unix, Microsoft Windows, and Apple Mac operating systems.  ESS
is itself a package within the emacs text editor and uses emacs
features to streamline the creation and use of statistical software. 
ESS knows the syntax and grammar of statistical analysis packages
and provides consistent display and editing features based on that
knowledge.  ESS assists in interactive and batch execution of
statements written in these statistical analysis languages.

<h2 class="chapter">1 Introduction to ESS</h2>

<p><a name="index-introduction-1"></a>
The S family (S, Splus and R) and SAS statistical analysis packages
provide sophisticated statistical and graphical routines for manipulating
data.   <b>E</b>macs <b>S</b>peaks <b>S</b>tatistics (ESS) is based on the merger
of two pre-cursors, S-mode and SAS-mode, which provided support for the
S family and SAS respectively.  Later on, Stata-mode was also incorporated.

   <p>ESS provides a common, generic, and useful interface, through emacs, to
many statistical packages.  It currently supports the S family, SAS, BUGS/JAGS,
Stata and XLisp-Stat with the level of support roughly in that order.

   <p>A bit of notation before we begin.  <em>emacs</em> refers to both
<em>GNU Emacs</em> by the Free Software Foundation, as well as
<em>XEmacs</em> by the XEmacs Project.  The emacs major
mode <code>ESS[language]</code>, where <code>language</code> can take values such as
<code>S</code>, <code>SAS</code>, or <code>XLS</code>.  The inferior process interface
(the connection between emacs and the running process) referred to as inferior ESS
(<code>iESS</code>), is denoted in the modeline by <code>ESS[dialect]</code>, where
<code>dialect</code> can take values such as <code>S3</code>, <code>S4</code>, <code>S+3</code>,
<code>S+4</code>, <code>S+5</code>, <code>S+6</code>, <code>S+7</code>, <code>R</code>, <code>XLS</code>, <code>VST</code>, <code>SAS</code>.

   <p>Currently, the documentation contains many references to <cite>`S'</cite>
where actually any supported (statistics) language is meant, i.e., `S'
could also mean `XLisp-Stat' or `SAS'.

   <p><a name="index-interactive-use-of-S-2"></a>
<a name="index-using-S-interactively-3"></a>For exclusively interactive users of S, ESS provides a number of
features to make life easier.  There is an easy to use command history
mechanism, including a quick prefix-search history.  To reduce typing,
command-line completion is provided for all S objects and &ldquo;hot
keys&rdquo; are provided for common S function calls.  Help files are
easily accessible, and a paging mechanism is provided to view them. 
Finally, an incidental (but very useful) side-effect of ESS is that a
transcript of your session is kept for later saving or editing.

   <p><a name="index-transcripts-of-S-sessions-4"></a>No special knowledge of Emacs is necessary when using S
interactively under ESS.

   <p><a name="index-programming-in-S-5"></a>For those that use S in the typical edit&ndash;test&ndash;revise cycle when
programming S functions, ESS provides for editing of S functions
in Emacs edit buffers.  Unlike the typical use of S where the editor
is restarted every time an object is edited, ESS uses the current Emacs
session for editing.  In practical terms, this means that you can edit
more than one function at once, and that the ESS process is still
available for use while editing.  Error checking is performed on
functions loaded back into S, and a mechanism to jump directly to the
error is provided.  ESS also provides for maintaining text versions of
your S functions in specified source directories.

<h3 class="section">1.1 Why should I use ESS?</h3>

<p>Statistical packages are powerful software systems for manipulating and
analyzing data, but their user interfaces often leave something something
to be desired:  they offer weak editor functionality and they differ
among themselves so markedly that you have to re-learn how to do those
things for each package.  ESS is a package which is designed to make
editing and interacting with statistical packages more uniform,
user-friendly and give you the power of emacs as well.

   <p>ESS provides several features which make it easier to interact with the
ESS process (a connection between your buffer and the statistical
package which is waiting for you to input commands).  These include:

     <ul>
<li><b>Command-line editing</b> for fixing mistakes in commands before they are
entered.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-e</span></samp>&rsquo; flag for S-plus provides something similar to
this, but here you have the full range of Emacs commands rather than a
limited subset.  However, other packages such as XLisp-Stat and S3 do not
necessarily have features like this built-in. 
See <a href="#Command_002dline-editing">Command-line editing</a>.

     <li><b>Searchable command history</b> for recalling previously-submitted
commands.  This provides all the features of the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Splus -e</span></samp>&rsquo; history
mechanism, plus added features such as history searching. 
See <a href="#Command-History">Command History</a>.

     <li><b>Command-line completion</b> of both object and file names for quick
entry.  This is similar to <code>tcsh</code>'s facility for filenames; here it
also applies to object names and list components. 
See <a href="#Completion">Completion</a>.

     <li><b>Hot-keys</b> for quick entry of commonly-used commands in `S' such as
<code>objects()</code> and <code>search()</code>. 
See <a href="#Hot-keys">Hot keys</a>.

     <li><b>Transcript recording</b> for a complete record of all the actions in an
S session. 
See <a href="#Transcript">Transcript</a>.

     <li><b>Interface to the help system</b>, with a specialized mode for viewing S
help files. 
See <a href="#Help">Help</a>.

   </ul>

   <p>If you commonly create or modify S functions, you will have found
the standard facilities for this (the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">fix()</span></samp>&rsquo; function, for
example) severely limiting.  Using S's standard features, one can only
edit one function at a time, and you can't continue to use S while
editing.  ESS corrects these problems by introducing the following
features:

     <ul>
<li><b>Object editing</b>.  ESS allows you to edit more than one function
simultaneously in dedicated Emacs buffers.  The ESS process may
continue to be used while functions are being edited. 
See <a href="#Edit-buffer">Edit buffer</a>.

     <li><b>A specialized editing mode</b> for S code, which provides syntactic
indentation and highlighting. 
See <a href="#Indenting">Indenting</a>.

     <li><b>Facilities for loading and error-checking source files</b>, including a
keystroke to jump straight to the position of an error in a source file. 
See <a href="#Error-Checking">Error Checking</a>.

     <li><b>Source code revision maintenance</b>, which allows you to keep historic
versions of S source files. 
See <a href="#Source-Files">Source Files</a>.

     <li><b>Facilities for evaluating S code</b> such as portions of source
files, or line-by-line evaluation of files (useful for debugging). 
See <a href="#Evaluating-code">Evaluating code</a>. 
</ul>

   <p>Finally, ESS provides features for re-submitting commands from saved
transcript files, including:

     <ul>
<li><b>Evaluation of previously entered commands</b>, stripping away
unnecessary prompts. 
See <a href="#Transcript-resubmit">Transcript resubmit</a>.

   </ul>

<h3 class="section">1.2 New features in ESS</h3>

     <ul>
Changes/New Features in 5.4:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: The long overdue change
from <code>make-regexp</code> to <code>regexp-opt</code> for font-locking is
complete.  The new <code>regexp-opt</code> is now the default since
it is better than the old code in many ways (and especially more
maintainable).  However, there are certainly some special
cases missed (bug reports and patches welcome!). 
Setting <code>ess-sas-run-regexp-opt</code> to <code>nil</code> will result
in the old code being used. 
<li><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> and <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>: typing <code>=</code> now results in
 <code>&lt;-</code>. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym> function arguments &ldquo;show&rdquo; <code>(ess-r-args-show)</code> now
 uses the new <code>(tooltip-show-at-point)</code> contributed by Erik Iverson. 
<li>Toolbar icons now also work in (beta) Emacs 23. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: New function <code>ess-change-directory</code> for setting both
 emacs' current directory and the directory of an *R* or *S* buffer. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> when transient-mark-mode is true, the mark is now kept,
 rather than deactivated, thanks to a patch from David Reitter. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.11:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: work around bug in Emacs 22.2 &amp; 22.3 which fails to
 set case-fold fontification automatically. 
<li>Rd mode: support new keyword 'Rdversion'
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: now again works with Emacs 21.x
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.10:
          <ul>
<li>Fixed noweb-mode bug accidentally introduced into 5.3.9
<li>In noweb-mode, e.g., Rnw-mode, electric &ldquo;&lt;&rdquo; also inserts closing &ldquo;@". 
 Further, the code chunk boundaries are better kept up-to-date, such that
 code[R] &lt;-&gt; text[LaTeX] minor mode switching should happen more reliably. 
<li>In noweb-mode, fix a buglet in rare [Enter] or [Tab] behavior; further,
 by default disable the former `[[' .. `]]'  code-protection-when-filling
 behavior which has been found to be buggy. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.9:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: evince PDF viewer now supported as well; search order:
evince, Xpdf, Adobe/Acrobat Reader
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: added support for Roxygen, potentially to be extended. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (and R): inferior (<code>*R*</code>) and transcript modes no longer
fontify language keywords (such as <code>for</code>, <code>in</code>, etc). 
<li>i<acronym>ESS[Stata]</acronym><!-- /@w -->: Customize the <code>ess-sta-delimiter-friendly</code> setting
to <code>t</code> to convert embedded semi-colons to newlines for Stata processing. 
<li>Sweave fix for embedded blanks in PDF reader and PDF files
<li>Several fixes for Major Mode Convention violations in <code>ess-mode</code>
and <code>noweb-mode</code>. 
<li><acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>: <code>M-x comment-region</code> now available! 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> The <code>ess-swv-*</code> commands (and keybindings) are now in
a submenu of the &ldquo;Noweb&rdquo; menu, when editing Sweave files. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.8:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>: more separation from <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> (as much as is currently planned);
now <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> on an empty <samp><span class="file">.jmd</span></samp> creates a template as it should;
symbolic links are created for CODA output so BOA is happy:
from <samp><span class="file">index.txt</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">.ind</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">chain#.txt</span></samp> to <samp><span class="file">#.out</span></samp>
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: buffer-local <code>ess-sas-submit-command</code> and
<code>ess-sas-submit-command-options</code> now recognized by <code>ess-sas-submit-region</code>
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: When trying to evaluate code in an S language buffer and
 there is no associated process, now start R automatically instead of
 signalling an error.  Also, restart R if there is an associated process
 which is not running.  However, do not start R just via the &ldquo;electric&rdquo;
 <kbd>(</kbd> (<code>ess-r-args-auto-show</code>). 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: For (one-line) functions withOUT '{ .. }' bodys, the end
 of function is now correctly found more often.  This notably improves
 <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step</code>). 
<li><acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>: cleanup/re-organization of elisp code;
symbolic links for CODA output are now only created by the new
JAGS <code>system</code> command in version 1.0.3; specify whether
this command is available via <code>ess-jags-system</code>; if not
present, then no links are created so that the <code>*shell*</code>
buffer does not become unresponsive during the batch run
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.7:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS</acronym>: <code>ess-default-style</code> now *is* customizable, i.e.,
  changing its value in <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> now does have the desired effect. 
<li><acronym>ESS</acronym>: <code>ess-font-lock-mode</code> is a new variable (default: t)
which controls whether font-locking is enabled in ESS buffers. 
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: for XEmacs on Windows; another tweak to find R versions
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: font-locking updated for ODS and SAS Bayesian Procedures;
a more consistent handling of SAS options by
<code>ess-sas-submit-command-options</code> which is buffer-local; portable
snooze for MS Windows via customize-able <code>ess-sleep-for</code> (floats welcome);
Xpdf now supported as a PDF viewer
<li><acronym>ESS[Rnw]</acronym>: now also works with &ldquo;emacs -nw&rdquo; and Emacs 22. 
<li><acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>: now requires JAGS 1.0 (see the new ESS for JAGS help
section for more information): both need work; suggestions welcome
<li><acronym>ESS[R]</acronym>: [TAB] completion now uses the R-internal completion
mechanism (for R &gt;= 2.5.0). 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> ([S]): interpretation of &ldquo;_&rdquo; as assignment has
been removed in <code>ess-continued-statement-p</code> for R and S. 
<li>several internal code cleanups. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: An experimental version of a new command <code>Rgui</code>
on MS Windows to send lines directly from emacs
to <code>Rgui</code> is available in file <code>lisp/essd-rgui.el</code>. 
Preliminary documentation is in file <code>doc/rgui-doc.txt</code>. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.6:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS</acronym>: for XEmacs, using &ldquo;gnuclient&rdquo; (without a &ldquo;-q&rdquo;) works for
 things like fix() after M-x gnuserv-start has been done. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: M-x R-newest should now work in more situations on MS
 Windows, e.g., when R has been installed in a non-default "ProgramFiles"
 directory tree.  In these cases, there's no need to specify the name (and
 full path) of the R program anymore. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: For XEmacs, startup (with new tooltip code) works again. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.5:
          <ul>
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> a new defun is available, <kbd>M-x R-newest</kbd>, which will start
the newest version of R that it can find on your system. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> add Sven Hartenstein's &ldquo;R function arguments tips&rdquo;
 functionality, via new file <samp><span class="file">../lisp/essd-r-args.el</span></samp>. 
 Note that this includes an &ldquo;electric "("&rdquo; behavior inside <code>R-mode</code>
 which is <em>active by default</em> and can be customized via
 <code>ess-r-args-electric-paren</code>; i.e., use <code>(setq
 ess-r-args-electric-paren nil)</code> to turn it off.  Further,
 <code>ess-r-args-show-as</code> allows to switch to the &ldquo;tooltip&rdquo; mode. 
<li><acronym>ESS</acronym>: functions <code>ess-get-pdf-viewer</code> and *-ps-viewer; built on new
 customizable variables <code>ess-pdf-viewer-pref</code> and
 <code>ess-ps-viewer-pref</code>; currently used in <code>ess-swv-PDF</code> and
 <code>*-PS</code>. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> Improved <code>ess-swv-PDF</code> to run pdf viewer only if
 pdflatex was ok
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> Improved <code>ess-swv-weave</code> to start R automatically if
 none is running. 
<li><acronym>ESS</acronym>: Do no longer ask <em>which</em> ESS process to use if there
 is only one. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.4:
          <ul>
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> now better work with options(error=recover); and the
new default of CHM help files on windows. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> some more cleanup in the &ldquo;sweave&rdquo; functions
<li>miscellaneous fixes
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.3:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> fix buglet (5.3.2 only) which left command prompt in
&ldquo;execute buffer&rdquo; and hence help files. 
<li>new customizable variable <code>ess-display-buffer-reuse-frames</code>
set to true (which changes default behavior) such that execution or
help *frames* are reused. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.2:
          <ul>
<li>Classic BUGS now supported by <code>(require 'essd-bugs)</code> with <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>
      and JAGS by <code>(require 'essd-jags)</code> with <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>.  But, only one
      of them can be used at a time since they don't play nice together.  Also,
      <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> is now bound to the function <code>ess-bugs-next-action</code>
      (<kbd>F12</kbd> has been retired).  And finally, note that <samp><span class="file">essl-bug.el</span></samp>
      is deprecated and the replacement is <samp><span class="file">essl-bugs.el</span></samp>. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> Improved some of the &ldquo;Sweave-make&rdquo;
 functions (yet scarcely documented) in <samp><span class="file">ess-swv.el</span></samp>. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> No longer mess with .Last.value (nor in other &ldquo;languages&rdquo;). 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.1:
          <ul>
<li>See the docs for 2 ways to install <acronym>ESS</acronym> for XEmacs
               <ol type=1 start=1>
      <li>by uncommenting the XEmacs part of
            Section 1 of <samp><span class="file">Makeconf</span></samp> and performing <code>make install</code>
      <li>by unpacking either
            <samp><span class="file">ess-5.3.1.tgz</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">ess-5.3.1.zip</span></samp> into
            <samp><span class="file">PREFIX/lib/xemacs/site-packages</span></samp> on unix or
            <samp><span class="file">PREFIX\XEmacs\site-packages</span></samp> on windows
               </ol>
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: fixed bugs so that Rterm.exe can be found by XEmacs
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: <kbd>ess-toggle-S-assign-key</kbd> is slightly changed; in
 particular, the default <code>ess-assign-key</code> is now <kbd>C-x =</kbd>. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: <kbd>M-x R-site-search</kbd> is a new (slightly experimental)
 utility similar to R's <code>RSiteSearch(..)</code> but with the advantage of
 using Emacs' preferred browser, see <code>browse-url-browser-function</code>
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.3.0:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>: sanely re-format statistical output, <samp><span class="file">.bog</span></samp>,
from scientific notation to numbers rounded with 4 decimal places
with <kbd>M-x ess-bugs-sci-round-to-4-dp</kbd>. 
<li>The keys for navigating among section headings in help buffers
worked, but only for one language per session; they should now work for
multiple languages.  (They were also broken on Windows machines.) 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> long standing buglets in the internal logic for loading
lisp code on Windows.  Particularly fixed behavior in help mode with S-plus
GUI. 
<li>New variable, <code>ess-use-inferior-program-name-in-buffer-name</code>,
which enables using the executable name instead of the dialect name for
R. Feature request. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> <kbd>ess-execute-screen-options</kbd>
now also works correctly when there is more than one window *side-by-side*
in the same frame and runs in the correct buffer also when there is more
than one S buffer. 
<li>i<acronym>ESS[S]</acronym><!-- /@w --> new functions <code>ess-eval-paragraph-and-step</code> and
 <code>ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step</code> are bound to keys
 <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd> and <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> respectively and to the menu in
 <acronym>ESS</acronym>-mode; also bound in the help mode (for evaluating examples). 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> new function <code>ess-toggle-S-assign-key</code> allows to
assign the &ldquo; &lt;- &rdquo; insertion to an arbitrary key. 
</ul>

</ul>

     <ul>
Changes/New Features in 5.2.12:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: <kbd>M-;</kbd> fixed, but the XEmacs function <code>comment-dwim</code>
may be broken, if so, use <kbd>M-x comment-region</kbd> and <kbd>M-x
uncomment-region</kbd> instead; only valid PROCs are fontified which is very
helpful finding syntax errors (currently supported: BASE, ETS, FSP, GRAPH,
IML, INSIGHT and STAT); the &ldquo;feature&rdquo; where <kbd>F</kbd>-keys take you to an
empty buffer when the requested destination is a file that does not exist
has been fixed, now the request results in a no-op. 
Further, sas-mode now also works in simple terminals. 
<li>Rterm/Cygwin combination works under Microsoft Windows. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: internal calls use baseenv() instead of NULL and
define 'baseenv' where needed. 
<li>New experimental support for installing ESS.  See the file
<samp><span class="file">lisp/ess-install.el</span></samp>. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.11:
          <ul>
<li>ESS Info entry and <samp><span class="file">dir</span></samp> handled more effectively for GNU Emacs users
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: temporary files created for batch submission of a
region are now named based on the current file; see <code>ess-sas-file-root</code>
for details; all <code>lag</code> and <code>dif</code> functions now fontified correctly
<li>iESS[SAS]: fixed a few nagging bugs, however, still does not appear to
work at this time; please let us know if you have any ideas. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Support for running other versions of Splus has been
added for unix.  Two new variables, <code>ess-s-versions</code> and
<code>ess-s-versions-list</code>, are used to tell ESS what other versions of
Splus you would like to run. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.10:
          <ul>
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: ess-r-versions can no longer be customized (since the
customization was not taking effect unless customizations were loaded
before ESS).  Its value has been changed so that it will also find R
executables beginning &ldquo;R-devel&rdquo; and &ldquo;R-patched&rdquo;.  If you wish to
change this variable, it must be set in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> before ESS is
loaded. 
<li>Installation with GNU Make enhanced:  unix and unix-like
operating systems will now be able to install <acronym>ESS</acronym> for all
users in either a GNU Emacs site-lisp or an XEmacs package
configuration by editing <samp><span class="file">lisp/ess-site.el</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">Makeconf</span></samp>
accordingly, then issuing <code>make install</code>
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Filename completion (inside strings) now also works in
XEmacs for R and S-plus. 
<!-- working around a bug in XEmacs -->
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.9:
          <ul>
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym> for Windows:  the \ directory character bug
with respect to ess-load-file has been eradicated. 
<li>i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w -->: <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> and <kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> once again
work as intended and documented. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: M-x ess-fix-EQ-assign is a bit more agressive. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Imenu now also shows setAs(), etc. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: R function pattern enhanced with underlying code such that
 <kbd>M-C-a</kbd> (<code>ess-beginning-of-function</code>) etc now work for many more
 cases, including S4 method definitions. 
<li>i<acronym&nbsp;title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym><!-- /@w -->: myOwnhelp(1) no longer wrongly triggers help(1). 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: Improved detection of bogus help buffers: valid help
 buffers containing with the string &ldquo;no documentation&rdquo;(e.g. contour)
 were being treated as bogus. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: In R help buffers, if <code>options("help.try.all.packages" =
 TRUE)</code> then <code>?rlm</code> will list which packages rlm is defined in.  This help
 buffer is not bogus, but instead is now relabelled &ldquo;*help[R](rlm in
 packages)*&rdquo;. 
<li><acronym>ESS[STA]</acronym>: add &ldquo;//&rdquo; as comment starting character to syntax-table. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.8:
          <ul>
<li>iESS: [Tab] completes <strong>file</strong> names &ldquo;inside string&rdquo; as in
earlier (&lt;= 5.2.3) ESS versions. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.7:
          <ul>
<li>If you use Custom to change the variable ess-toolbar-items,
the new toolbar is used in all subsequent ESS buffers. 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: new feature:  if ess-sas-log-max &gt;0 and
your .log grows to more than ess-sas-log-max bytes, just
the first ess-sas-log-max bytes are refreshed; this is helpful when your .sas program
generates lots of error messages and gets too big for emacs to display
<li><acronym>ESS[R/S]</acronym>: <kbd>M-;</kbd> in R/S editing modes will now indent with
either one or two hashes depending on context. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: David Whiting's Sweave extensions (to 'noweb')
are now available (from ess-swv.el loaded by default). 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.6:
          <ul>
<li>Removed non-ASCII characters in a few files. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: now works better when UTF-8 locale is active; in
 particular, you get correct directional quotes in R's startup message
 for R-devel (unstable development version of R 2.1.0) when using
 environment variables LANGUAGE=en@quot LC_ALL=en_US.UTF-8
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: toggling of .log mode improved (<kbd>F10</kbd>); toggling of
.lst mode now also available (<kbd>C-F10</kbd>); killing all buffers associated
with .sas program no longer bound to <kbd>C-F10</kbd> since its a bit overzealous. 
<li>S-Plus 7 for Windows is now recognized. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (incl. R): in auto-fill mode, strings are not wrapped anymore. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (incl. R): font-lock now correctly differs between R and S,
e.g., for "_"; both now fontify warning(.) and S does terminate() additionally. 
<li>Support for `bell' aka `beep' aka `ding' aka `alarm' in all inferior
modes: When \a is output &ldquo;to the the console&rdquo; at the beginning of a line,
the bell is rung. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.5:
          <ul>
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd> or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Quit S</span></samp>&rsquo; from the menu now should work
(again and less klunkily) and do not append &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-exited</span></samp>&rsquo; to the
buffer name.  Further, the behavior of <code>(ess-cleanup)</code>, called from
ess-quit, now depends on the new customizable variable
<code>ess-S-quit-kill-buffers-p</code> which defaults to <code>nil</code>. 
Consequently, the question <em>&ldquo;Delete all buffers associated
with ..?&rdquo;</em> will not be asked anymore by default. 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> &ndash; ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace will now work
with the <code>recode</code> application as well which is available on many platforms
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (incl. R): Name completion for slots of S4 objects now works! 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.4:
          <ul>
<li>The documentation now includes an overview of how to use the emacs
TAGS facility for S functions.  (The distribution also used to contain a
directory <samp><span class="file">etc/other/Tags</span></samp> where a ~1990 version of <samp><span class="file">etags.c</span></samp> was
distributed; this is no longer relevant and so has been deleted.) 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> &ndash; When you are working with EBCDIC files on an ASCII
platform, .log NOTEs may display as gibberish since the EBCDIC
characters are not converted to ASCII prior to their display.  So,
the function ess-ebcdic-to-ascii-search-and-replace is provided for
convenience and is bound to <kbd>C-F11</kbd>.  This function requires the
<code>dd</code> command (only available on unix or unix-like platforms). 
<li>ESS: Completion of object names is now always done dynamically rather
than allowing the option of using a pre-computed database (by
<code>ess-create-object-name-db</code>) since modern computers seem fast
enough for dynamic completion.  (We expect few users, if any, have
been using the pre-computed database method.) 
<li>ESS: object completion in iESS buffers running on Windows was
very slow (for GNU Emacs, but not XEmacs) and has now been fixed. 
Further, it was more or less broken for all versions of S-plus 6.x,
and has been fixed to work everywhere but with the Windows' GUI of
S-plus.  The list of objects now shows unique names also when an
object appears more than once in the search path. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: Completion of object names now also includes those
starting with &ldquo;.&rdquo;. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.3:
          <ul>
<li>ESS: When new inferior ESS processes are created, by default they
will replace the current buffer (this restores behavior from pre
5.2.0). If you wish new ESS processes to start in another window of the
current frame, set inferior-ess-same-window to nil. 
<li>New variables inferior-Splus-args and inferior-R-args provide a
way to pass command line arguments to starting S and R processes. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.2:
          <ul>
<li>bug-fixes for 5.2.1 (require 'executable), html docs, etc. 
<li>ess-lisp-directory/../doc/info added to Info-directory-list
if ess-info not found by info
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: If you have other versions of R on your
exec-path, such as "R-1.8.1" with Unix or "rw1081" with Windows,
ESS will find them and create appropriate functions, such as
<kbd>M-x R-1.8.1</kbd> or <kbd>M-x rw1081</kbd>, for calling them. 
By default only Unix programs beginning "R-1" and
"R-2" and Windows programs parallel to the
version of R in your exec-path will be found,
but see ess-r-versions and ess-rterm-versions for ways to find other
versions of R. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: Other versions of R, such as "R-1.8.1" on Unix and "rw1081" on
Windows, are added to the
"ESS / Start Process / Other" menu. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: If you have other versions of S-Plus on your Windows computer,
such as S-Plus 6.1 or S-Plus 4.5, ESS will find them and create appropriate
functions, such as <kbd>M-x splus61</kbd>, for calling the console version (Sqpe)
inside an emacs buffer.  By default only
programs installed in the default location will be found, but see
ess-SHOME-versions for ways to find other versions of S-Plus. 
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Other versions of Sqpe on Windows, such as "splus61",
are added to the
"ESS / Start Process / Other" menu. 
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>: (bug fix) ess-quit (bound to <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd>) should now quit the
inferior R process, when issued from either the inferior buffer, or from
a .R buffer. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.1:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> (R and S-plus): now have toolbar support
with icons to evaluate code in the inferior process or to switch
there.  This code is experimental and likely to change as XEmacs/Emacs
issues get resolved. The toolbar should be enabled if your Emacs
displays images, but can be disabled with the variable ess-use-toolbar. 
Thanks to David Smith from Insightful for the S-plus logo. 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: ess-sas-graph-view (<kbd>F12</kbd>) enhanced; you can specify
external file viewers for each graphics file type via the alist
ess-sas-graph-view-viewer-alist; also .jpg/.gif are now handled
by image-mode on XEmacs, if available, otherwise by graphics
primitives as before
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.2.0:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>:  new info documentation!  now supports interactive
processing thanks to <a href="mailto:Aki.Vehtari@hut.fi">Aki Vehtari</a>;
new architecture-independent unix support as well as support for BUGS v. 0.5
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>:  convert .log to .sas with ess-sas-transcript;
info documentation improved; Local Variable bug fixes;
SAS/IML statements/functions now highlighted; files edited
remotely by ange-ftp/EFS/tramp are recognized and pressing
SUBMIT opens a buffer on the remote host via the local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init which defaults to "ssh";
changed the definition of the variable ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle
to boolean rather than 0/1; added the function ess-electric-run-semicolon
which automatically reverse indents lines containing only "run;";
<kbd>C-F1</kbd> creates MS RTF portrait from the current buffer;
<kbd>C-F2</kbd> creates MS RTF landscape from the current buffer;
<kbd>C-F9</kbd> opens a SAS DATASET with PROC INSIGHT rather than PROC FSVIEW;
"inferior" aliases for SAS batch:  <kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> for submit region,
<kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> for submit buffer, <kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> for goto .log; <kbd>C-c C-y</kbd> for goto .lst
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: Pressing underscore ("_") once inserts " &lt;- " (as before);
pressing underscore twice inserts a literal underscore.  To stop this
smart behaviour, add "(ess-toggle-underscore nil)" to your .emacs after
ess-site has been loaded;
ess-dump-filename-template-proto (new name!) now can be
customized successfully (for S language dialects);
Support for Imenu has been improved; set ess-imenu-use-S to non-nil to
get an "Imenu-S" item on your menubar;
ess-help: Now using nice underlines (instead of `nuke-* ^H_')
<li><acronym title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym>:  After (require 'essa-r), <kbd>M-x ess-r-var</kbd> allows to load
numbers from any Emacs buffer into an existing *R* process;
<kbd>M-x ess-rdired</kbd> gives a &ldquo;directory editor&rdquo; of R objects;
fixed ess-retr-lastvalue-command, i.e. .Last.value bug
(thanks to David Brahm)
<li>ESS: Support for creating new window frames has been added to
ESS.  Inferior ESS processes can be created in dedicated frames by
setting inferior-ess-own-frame to t.  ESS help buffers can also open in
new frames; see the documentation for ess-help-own-frame for details. 
(Thanks to Kevin Rodgers for contributing code.) 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.24:
          <ul>
<li>The version number is now correct even inside ESS/Emacs
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.23:
          <ul>
<li>Minor more Makefile clean up. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.22:
          <ul>
<li>Besides info documentation, PDF and HTML
documentation are also provided (instead of built using "make") and available
on the web as well; see <a href="http://ess.r-project.org/">ESS web page</a> and <a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/doc">StatLib</a>
<li>Now that info documentation is available, the
README.* files are no longer supported.  However, they
are still distributed for what it's worth. 
<li>ESS is now an XEmacs package!  See
<a href="http://www.xemacs.org/Install/index.html">XEmacs Installation HOWTO</a>
for details (specifically, items 10-15). 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: more user-friendly enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit file transfers (LOG and OUTPUT
function key features now supported).  Multiple shells
now supported so you can run SAS on different computers
from different buffers by setting the buffer-local variable
ess-sas-shell-buffer to unique buffer names. 
<li>Major re-vamping of Makefile/Makeconf. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.21:
          <ul>
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: info documentation now available!, see
ESS-&gt;Help for SAS; <kbd>F12</kbd> opens GSASFILE nearest point for viewing
either within emacs, when available, or via an external viewer;
more syntax highlighting keywords; more enhancements for remote
SAS batch jobs with Kermit; new framework for remote SAS interactive
jobs, see ess-remote
<li><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym>: info documentation now available!, see
ESS-&gt;Help for the S family
<li>Makefile: tag now independent of rel; info files
made by doc/Makefile and installed in new info sub-directory
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.20:
          <ul>
<li>New `options()$STERM' in the S dialects (S, S-Plus, R). 
The S program can determine the environment in which it is
currently running.  ESS sets the option to `iESS' or `ddeESS'
when it starts an S language process.  We recommend other specific
values for S language processes that ESS does not start. 
<li>New `ess-mouse-me' function, assigned to S-mouse-3 by default. 
User may click on a word or region and then choose from the
menu to display the item, or a summary, or a plot, etc. 
This feature is still under development. 
<li>GNU Emacs 21.1 is now supported (fixed for S dialects, SAS &amp; BUGS),
(some from Stephen Eglen). 
<li>XEmacs 21.x is now supported (fixed w32-using-nt bug)
<li>XEmacs on Win (NT) is better supported. 
<li>Workaround for bug in Sqpe+6 (S-PLUS 6 for Win). 
<li>should now work even when imenu is not available (for old XEmacsen). 
<li><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>: XEmacs-Imenu fix; <kbd>C-TAB</kbd> is globalized along with your
function-key definitions, if specified; you can specify your SAS
library definitions outside of autoexec.sas for ess-sas-data-view
with SAS code placed in the variable ess-sas-data-view-libname,
also the dataset name is defaulted to the nearest permanent dataset
to point; Speedbar support now works for permanent datasets, please
ignore first./last.; new font-locking is now the default with more
improvements for font-locking PROCs, macro statements, * ; and %* ;
comments; you can toggle sas-log-mode with <kbd>F10</kbd> which will font-lock
your .log (if it isn't too big); submit remote .sas files accessed
with ange-ftp, EFS or Tramp (Kermit is experimental) by setting
ess-sas-submit-method to 'sh; ess-sas-submit-command and
ess-sas-submit-command-options are buffer-local so you can have
local file variable sections at the end of your .sas files to
request different executables or specify special options and the
local file variables are re-read at submit instead of only at file
open so that if you make a change it is picked up immediately;
<li><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>: font-lock with `in' fixed. 
<li>for STATA: font-lock bug fixed. 
<li>for Rd mode: <kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> and `switch-process' in menu. 
further, <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> prefix (Rd-font) for inserting or surrounding a word
by things such as \code{.}, \code{\link{.}}, \emph{.} etc. 
<li>new functions (ess-directory-function) and (ess-narrow-to-defun)
ess-directory &lt;-&gt; default-directory logic (Jeff Mincy). 
<li>Re-organized Makefile and fixed a few bugs. 
</ul>

     <p>Changes/New Features in 5.1.19:
          <ul>
<li>S+6 now supported (Tony Rossini (Unix) and Rich Heiberger (Windows))
<li>New BUGS support through <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> mode (Rodney Sparapani)

<h3 class="section">1.3 Authors of and contributors to ESS</h3>

<p><a name="index-comint-6"></a><a name="index-authors-7"></a><a name="index-credits-8"></a>
The ESS environment is built on the open-source projects of many
contributors, dating back to 1989 where Doug Bates and Ed Kademan wrote
S-mode to edit S and Splus files in GNU Emacs.  Frank Ritter and Mike
Meyer added features, creating version 2.  Meyer and David Smith made
further contributions, creating version 3.  For version 4, David Smith
provided significant enhancements to allow for powerful process
interaction.

   <p>John Sall wrote GNU Emacs macros for SAS source code around 1990.  Tom
Cook added functions to submit jobs, review listing and log files, and
produce basic views of a dataset, thus creating a SAS-mode which was
distributed in 1994.

   <p>In 1994, A.J. Rossini extended S-mode to support XEmacs.  Together
with extensions written by Martin Maechler, this became version 4.7
and supported S, Splus, and R.  In 1995, Rossini extended SAS-mode to
work with XEmacs.

   <p>In 1997, Rossini merged S-mode and SAS-mode into a single Emacs
package for statistical programming; the product of this marriage was
called ESS version 5.  Richard M. Heiberger designed the inferior mode
for interactive SAS and SAS-mode was further integrated into ESS. 
Thomas Lumley's Stata mode, written around 1996, was also folded into
ESS.  More changes were made to support additional statistical
languages, particularly XLispStat.

   <p>ESS initially worked only with Unix statistics packages that used
standard-input and standard-output for both the command-line interface
and batch processing.  ESS could not communicate with statistical
packages that did not use this protocol.  This changed in 1998 when
Brian Ripley demonstrated use of the Windows Dynamic Data Exchange
(DDE) protocol with ESS.  Heiberger then used DDE to provide
interactive interfaces for Windows versions of Splus.  In 1999, Rodney
A. Sparapani and Heiberger implemented SAS batch for ESS relying
on files, rather than standard-input/standard-output, for Unix,
Windows and Mac.  In 2001, Sparapani added BUGS batch file processing
to ESS for Unix and Windows.

     <ul>
<li>The multiple process code, and the idea for
<code>ess-eval-line-and-next-line</code> are by Rod Ball.

     <li>Thanks to Doug Bates for many useful suggestions.

     <li>Thanks to Martin Maechler for reporting and fixing bugs, providing many
useful comments and suggestions, and for maintaining the ESS mailing
lists.

     <li>Thanks to Frank Ritter for updates, particularly the menu code, and
invaluable comments on the manual.

     <li>Thanks to Ken'ichi Shibayama for his excellent indenting code, and many
comments and suggestions.

     <li>Thanks to Aki Vehtari for adding interactive BUGS support.

     <li>Thanks to Brendan Halpin for bug-fixes and updates to Stata-mode.

     <li>Last, but definitely not least, thanks to the many ESS users and
contributors to the ESS mailing lists.

<h3 class="section">1.4 Getting the latest version of ESS</h3>

<p>The latest released version of ESS is always available on the web at:
<a href="http://ess.r-project.org">ESS web page</a> or
<a href="http://lib.stat.cmu.edu/general/ESS/">StatLib</a>

<!-- There no longer is an anonymous CVS repository for ESS, due to lack of -->
<!-- interest, little demand, and problems with security. -->
<!-- text below modified from R-admin.texi (thanks to Kurt for the tip). -->
   <p>The latest development version of ESS is available via
<a href="https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/">https://svn.R-project.org/ESS/</a>, the ESS Subversion repository.  If
you have a Subversion client (see <a href="http://subversion.tigris.org/">http://subversion.tigris.org/</a>),
you can download the sources using:
<pre class="smallexample">     % svn checkout https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk <var>path</var>
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">which will put the ESS files into directory <var>path</var>.  Later,
within that directory, `svn update' will bring that directory up to
date.  Windows-based tools such as TortoiseSVN are also available for
downloading the files.  Alternatively, you can browse the sources with a
web browser at: <a href="https://svn.r-project.org/ESS/trunk">ESS SVN site</a>.  However, please use a subversion client instead to minimize the
load when retrieving.

   <p>If you remove other versions of ESS from your emacs load-path, you can
then use the development version by adding the following to .emacs:

<pre class="example">     (load "/path/to/ess-svn/lisp/ess-site.el")
</pre>
   <p>Note that https is required, and that the SSL certificate for the
Subversion server of the R project is

<pre class="smallexample">     Certificate information:
      - Hostname: svn.r-project.org

<h3 class="section">1.5 How to read this manual</h3>

<p>If you need to install ESS, read <a href="#Installation">Installation</a> for details on what
needs to be done before proceeding to the next chapter.

   <p>In this manual we use the standard notation for describing the
keystrokes used to invoke certain commands.  <kbd>C-&lt;chr&gt;</kbd> means hold
the CONTROL key while typing the character &lt;chr&gt;. <kbd>M-&lt;chr&gt;</kbd> means
hold the META or EDIT or ALT key down while typing &lt;chr&gt;. If there is no
META, EDIT or ALT key, instead press and release the ESC key and then
type &lt;chr&gt;.

   <p>All ESS commands can be invoked by typing <kbd>M-x command</kbd>.  Most of
the useful commands are bound to keystrokes for ease of use.  Also, the
most popular commands are also available through the emacs menubar, and
finally, if available, a small subset are provided on the toolbar. 
Where possible, keybindings are similar to other modes in emacs to
strive for a consistent user interface within emacs, regardless of the
details of which programming language is being edited, or process being
run.

   <p>Some commands, such as <kbd>M-x R</kbd> can accept an optional `prefix'
argument.  To specify the prefix argument, you would type <kbd>C-u</kbd>
before giving the command.  e.g. If you type <kbd>C-u M-x R</kbd>, you will
be asked for command line options that you wish to invoke the R process
with.

   <p>Emacs is often referred to as a `self-documenting' text editor.  This
applies to ESS in two ways.  First, limited documentation about each ESS
command can be obtained by typing <kbd>C-h f</kbd>.  For example, if you type
<kbd>C-h f ess-eval-region</kbd>, documentation for that command will appear
in a separate *Help* buffer.  Second, a complete list of keybindings
that are available in each ESS mode and brief description of that mode
is available by typing <kbd>C-h m</kbd> within an ESS buffer.

   <p>Emacs is a versatile editor written in both C and lisp; ESS is written
in the Emacs lisp dialect (termed `elisp') and thus benefits from the
flexible nature of lisp.  In particular, many aspects of ESS behaviour
can be changed by suitable customization of lisp variables.  This manual
mentions some of the most frequent variables.  A full list of them
however is available by using the Custom facility within emacs.  (Type
<kbd>M-x customize-group RET ess RET</kbd> to get started.) 
<a href="#Customization">Customization</a> provides details of common user variables you can
change to customize ESS to your taste, but it is recommended that you
defer this section until you are more familiar with ESS.

   <p><em>XEmacs Simple Instructions:</em> for recent versions of XEmacs (21.x or higher),
the installation process is much simpler.  Hopefully, these
simple instructions will work for you.  If not, then more
detailed, manual instructions follow.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Extract all the files from <samp><span class="file">ess-VERSION.zip</span></samp> (by
double clicking on it and selecting &ldquo;Extract all files&rdquo;
which launches the Folders Extraction Wizard)
into the <samp><span class="file">site-packages</span></samp> directory that exists for packages like <acronym>ESS</acronym>. 
If XEmacs was installed in the default location, then this
directory can be found at
<samp><span class="file">C:\Program Files\XEmacs\site-packages</span></samp>.

     <li>XEmacs requires the <code>HOME</code> environment variable to be defined.  You can
create it by visiting the following dialog:
<code>My Computer-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Environment Variables</code>
In the User variables window, press New.  And create a variable
named <code>HOME</code> with a value something like (you must
use forward slashes <code>/</code> rather than backslashes <code>\</code>)
<code>c:/Documents and Settings/%USERNAME%/Application Data</code>.  Then press OK for that
window and press OK for the main window.  <em>If you also have GNU Emacs
installed, GNU Emacs will recognize </em><code>HOME</code><em> and expand </em><code>~</code><em> accordingly.</em>

     <li>Now launch XEmacs and do a <code>C-x C-f</code> followed by a <code>~</code>. 
From the Subdir menu, select Create Directory, and enter <code>.xemacs</code>

     <li>Add the line
     <pre class="example">          (require 'ess-site)
</pre>
     <p>to <samp><span class="file">~/.xemacs/init.el</span></samp> and restart XEmacs.

     <li>If you see a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*ESS*</span></samp>, then the simple instructions
were most likely successful.  If not, then read further.

     <li>It could be you have an older version of XEmacs or some other problem
with your installation.  Either way, you may need to edit
<samp><span class="file">C:\ess\ess-VERSION\lisp\ess-site.el</span></samp> manually.  If that is the case,
then you should create a directory just for <acronym>ESS</acronym> like <samp><span class="file">C:\ess</span></samp> and
unpack <acronym>ESS</acronym> there.  That way, your changes to
<samp><span class="file">C:\ess\ess-VERSION\lisp\ess-site.el</span></samp>
will not be lost if you update XEmacs later.

     <li>Replace the line above with
     <pre class="example">          (load "C:/ess/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
</pre>
     <p>in <samp><span class="file">~/.xemacs/init.el</span></samp> and restart XEmacs.

     <li>If you see a buffer named <samp><span class="file">*ESS*</span></samp>, then the manual instructions
were most likely successful.  If not, then send a query to
<a href="mailto:ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>
explicitly describing your problem and your environment
including operating system, XEmacs version, <acronym>ESS</acronym> version, etc.
        </ol>

   <p>Now, you should be ready to use <acronym>ESS</acronym>.  For example, to edit
statistical programs, load the files with the requisite extensions
(".sas" for SAS, ".S" or "s" or "q" or "Q" for S-PLUS, ".r" or ".R" for
R, and ".lsp" for XLispStat).  One further step is needed if you wish to
run statistical processes, see below.

   <p>To run statistical processes under <acronym>ESS</acronym>, Windows users will need to make
sure that the directories for the software they will be using is in the
PATH environment variable.

   <p>On Windows NT/2000/XP, add the directories to the PATH using the
<code>My Computer-&gt;Control Panel-&gt;System-&gt;Advanced-&gt;Environment Variables</code> menu. 
Note that the directory containing the program is
added to the PATH, not the program itself.  One such line is needed
for each software program.  Be sure to use the abbreviation
<code>progra~1</code> and not the long version with embedded blanks as
this may cause problems.  Also, make sure to use backslashes <code>\</code>
since Windows requires them.

   <p>An alternative, for R users, is that rather than adjusting the PATH
variable, you can add the following to your emacs initialization file
(and restart emacs):
<pre class="example">     (setq inferior-R-program-name "c:/progra~1/R/R-2.2.1/bin/Rterm.exe")
</pre>
   <p>This assumes that you have installed R-2.2.1 in the default location. 
Change the path otherwise to point to other locations.

   <p>Windows users who place S-PLUS anywhere other than the default
location will also need to add the following three lines (properly
adjusted for their location):
<pre class="example">     (setq-default inferior-S+6-program-name
         "c:/progra~1/Insightful/SPLUS70/cmd/Splus")
     (setq-default inferior-Sqpe+6-SHOME-name
         "c:/progra~1/Insightful/SPLUS70")
     (setq-default inferior-Sqpe+6-program-name
         "c:/progra~1/Insightful/SPLUS70/cmd/Sqpe.exe")
</pre>
   <p>The above example uses the default location of S-PLUS in
<code>c:\progra~1\Insightful</code>.  Please note that <acronym>ESS</acronym>
considers S-PLUS 6, 7, and 8 to be variants of S+6.

   <p>These users may also need to modify the emacs variable <code>ess-SHOME-versions</code>
to match their installation in order to get the full set of S-PLUS versions
on their machine into the <acronym>ESS</acronym> menu.

   <p>To start the S-PLUS [678].x GUI from ESS under emacs:
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>If you use Cygwin bash as your primary shell, then
     <pre class="example">          M-x S
          (or <code>M-x S+6</code>).
</pre>
     <li>If you use the MSDOS prompt window as your primary shell, then
     <pre class="example">          M-x S+6-msdos
</pre>
     </ol>
You will then be
asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory
as the default.  ESS will start the S-PLUS GUI.  There will be
slight delay during which emacs is temporarily frozen.  ESS will arrange for
communication with the S-PLUS GUI using the DDE protocol. 
Send lines or regions
from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
<samp><span class="file">myfile.s</span></samp>) to the S-PLUS Commands Window with the
<code>C-c C-n</code> or <code>C-c C-r</code> keys. 
(If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000,\
then use <code>M-x S+4</code> or <code>M-x S+4-msdos</code>.)

   <p>To start an S-PLUS [678].x session inside an emacs buffer&mdash;and
without the S-PLUS GUI:
<pre class="example">     M-x Sqpe
     (or <code>M-x Sqpe+6</code>).
</pre>
   <p>This works with both the bash and msdos shells. 
You will then be asked for a pathname ("S starting data
directory?"), from which to start the process.  The prompt will
propose your current directory as the default. 
You get Unix-like behavior, in particular the entire
transcript is available for emacs-style search commands. 
Send lines or regions from the emacs buffer containing your S
program (for example, <samp><span class="file">myfile.s</span></samp>) to the *S+6* buffer with the
<code>C-c C-n</code> or <code>C-c C-r</code> keys. 
Interactive graphics are available with Sqpe by using the java
library supplied with S-PLUS 6.1 and newer releases. 
Enter the commands:
<pre class="example">     library(winjava)
     java.graph()
</pre>
   <p>Graphs can be saved from the <code>java.graph</code> device
in several formats, but not PostScript.   If you
need a PostScript file you will need to open a separate
<code>postscript</code> device. 
(If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000, then use <code>M-x Sqpe+4</code>.)

   <p>To connect to an already running S-PLUS GUI (started, for example,
from the S-PLUS icon):
<pre class="example">     M-x S+6-existing
</pre>
   <p>or
<pre class="example">     M-x S+6-msdos-existing
</pre>
   <p>You will then be
asked for a pathname ("S starting data directory?"), from which to
start the process.  The prompt will propose your current directory
as the default.  ESS will arrange for
communication with the already running S-PLUS GUI using the DDE protocol. 
Send lines or regions
from the emacs buffer containing your S program (for example,
<samp><span class="file">myfile.s</span></samp>) to the S-PLUS Commands Window with the
<code>C-c C-n</code> or <code>C-c C-r</code> keys. 
(If you are still using S-PLUS 4.x or 2000,
 then use <code>M-x S+4-existing</code> or <code>M-x S+4-msdos-existing</code>.)

   <p>If you wish to run R, you can start it with:
<pre class="example">     M-x R
</pre>
   <p>XLispStat can not currently be run with
<pre class="example">     M-x XLS
</pre>
   <p>Hopefully, this will change.  However, you can still edit with
emacs, and cut and paste the results into the XLispStat
*Listener* Window under Microsoft Windows.

<h3 class="section">2.3 Requirements</h3>

<p>ESS is most likely to work with current/recent versions of the following
statistical packages: R/S-PLUS, SAS, Stata and JAGS. The one exception
is BUGS which is quite old, but should still work.

   <p>ESS supports current/recent versions of GNU Emacs and XEmacs. 
Most notably, the GNU Emacs 22 series and XEmacs 21.4.14 or higher
(beta/pre-release versions are NOT SUPPORTED).

<h2 class="chapter">3 Interacting with statistical programs</h2>

<p>As well as using ESS to edit your source files for statistical programs,
you can use ESS to run these statistical programs.  In this chapter, we
mostly will refer by example to running S from within emacs.  The emacs
convention is to name such processes running under its control as
`inferior processes'.  This term can be slightly misleading, in which
case these processes can be thought of `interactive processes'.  Either
way, we use the term `iESS' to refer to the Emacs mode used to interact
with statistical programs.

<h3 class="section">3.2 Running more than one ESS process</h3>

<p><a name="index-Multiple-ESS-processes-19"></a>
ESS allows you to run more than one ESS process simultaneously in the
same session.  Each process has a name and a number; the initial process
<a name="index-process-names-20"></a>(process 1) is simply named (using S-PLUS as an example) &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S+3:1</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
<!-- You may start a new process by passing a numeric argument to -->
<!-- @kbd{M-x S}.  For example, typing @kbd{ESC 2 M-x S} starts up -->
<!-- an ESS process with name @samp{S2}, in a buffer whose name -->
<!-- is initially @samp{*S2*}. -->
The name of the process is shown in the mode line in square brackets
(for example, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">[S+3:2]</span></samp>&rsquo;); this is useful if the process buffer is
renamed.  Without a prefix argument, <kbd>M-x S</kbd> starts a new ESS
process, using the first available process number.  With a prefix
argument (for R), <kbd>C-u M-x R</kbd> allows for the specification of
command line options.

   <p><a name="index-ess_002drequest_002da_002dprocess-21"></a>You can switch to any active ESS process with the command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x ess-request-a-process</span></samp>&rsquo;.  Just enter the name of the process
you require; completion is provided over the names of all running S
processes.  This is a good command to consider binding to a global key.

<!-- SJE - commented outl the default behaviour now is to label *S* rather -->
<!-- than *S:1*. -->
<!-- @vindex ess-plain-first-buffername -->
<!-- For the predecessor to ESS (S-mode 4.8), the initial process was not -->
<!-- visibly numbered, i.e. S instead of S1 was used in the mode-line.  To -->
<!-- obtain this behavior, set the variable @code{ess-plain-first-buffername} -->
<!-- to @code{t}.  See @file{ess-site} for how to set this for all users. -->

<h3 class="section">3.3 ESS processes on Remote Computers</h3>

ESS works with processes on remote computers as easily as with
processes on the local machine.  The recommended way to access a
statistical program on remote computer is to start it from a telnet or
ssh buffer and then connect ESS to that buffer.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Start a new telnet or ssh buffer and connect to the remote computer
(e.g. use &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x telnet</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x ssh</span></samp>&rsquo;; ssh.el is available at
<a href="ftp://ftp.splode.com/pub/users/friedman/emacs-lisp/ssh.el">ftp://ftp.splode.com/pub/users/friedman/emacs-lisp/ssh.el</a>).

     <li>Start the ESS process on the remote machine, for example with one of
the commands &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Splus</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo;, or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sas -stdio</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>Enter the ESS command &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x ess-remote</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You will be prompted for
a program name.  Enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sp6</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">r</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sas</span></samp>&rsquo; or another
valid name.  Your telnet process is now known to ESS.  All the usual
ESS commands (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-c C-n</span></samp>&rsquo; and its relatives) now work with the S
language processes.  For SAS you need to use a different command
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-c i</span></samp>&rsquo; (that is a regular &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">i</span></samp>&rsquo;, not a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-i</span></samp>&rsquo;) to send
lines from your <samp><span class="file">myfile.sas</span></samp> to the remote SAS process. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-c i</span></samp>&rsquo; sends lines over invisibly. 
<!-- and lets SAS display them formatted correctly as in a SAS log file. -->
With ess-remote you get teletype behavior&mdash;the data input, the
log, and the listing all appear in the same buffer.  To make this work,
you need to end every PROC and DATA step with a "RUN;" statement.  The
"RUN;" statement is what tells SAS that it should process the preceding
input statements.

     <li>Graphics (interactive) on the remote machine.  If you run X11
(See <a href="#X11">X11</a>, X-windows)
on both the local and remote machines then you should be able to
display the graphs locally by setting the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DISPLAY</span></samp>&rsquo; environment
variable appropriately.  Windows users can download &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xfree86</span></samp>&rsquo;
from cygwin.

     <li>Graphics (static) on the remote machine. 
If you don't run the X window system on the local machine, then you can write
graphics to a file on the remote machine, and display the file in
a graphics viewer on the local machine.  Most statistical software can
write one or more of postscript, GIF, or JPEG files. 
Depending on the versions of emacs and the operating system that you
are running, emacs itself may display &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.gif</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.jpg</span></samp>&rsquo;
files.  Otherwise, a graphics file viewer will be needed. 
Ghostscript/ghostview may be downloaded to display &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.ps</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.eps</span></samp>&rsquo; files.  Viewers for GIF and JPEG are usually included with
operating systems.  See <a href="#ESS_0028SAS_0029_002d_002dFunction-keys-for-batch-processing">ESS(SAS)&ndash;Function keys for batch processing</a>,
for more information on using the F12 key for displaying graphics files
with SAS.
        </ol>

   <p>Should you or a colleague inadvertently start a statistical process in
an ordinary &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*shell*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer, the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ess-remote</span></samp>&rsquo; command can
be used to convert it to an ESS buffer and allow you to use the ESS
commands with it.

   <p>We have two older commands, now deprecated, for accessing ESS processes
on remote computers. 
See <a href="#S_002belsewhere-and-ESS_002delsewhere">S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere</a>.

<h3 class="section">3.4 S+elsewhere and ESS-elsewhere</h3>

<p>These commands are now deprecated.  We recommend &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ess-remote</span></samp>&rsquo;.  We
have two versions of the elsewhere function.  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S+elsewhere</span></samp>&rsquo; is
specific for the S-Plus program.  The more general function
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ESS-elsewhere</span></samp>&rsquo; is not as stable.

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>Enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x S+elsewhere</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
You will be prompted for a starting directory.  I usually give it my
project directory on the local machine, say  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~myname/myproject/</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <p>Or enter &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x ESS-elsewhere</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You will be prompted for an ESS
program and for a starting directory.  I usually give it my project
directory on the local machine, say &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~myname/myproject/</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <li>The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*S+3*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer will appear with a prompt from the
local operating system (the unix prompt on a unix workstation or with
cygwin bash on a PC, or the msdos prompt on a PC without bash).  emacs
may freeze because the cursor is at the wrong place.  Unfreeze it with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-g</span></samp>&rsquo; then move the cursor to the end with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
With &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">S+elsewhere</span></samp>&rsquo; the buffer name is based on the name of the ESS program. 
<li>Enter
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">telnet myname@other.machine</span></samp>&rsquo; (or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">ssh myname@other.machine</span></samp>&rsquo;). 
You will be prompted for your password on the remote machine. 
Use
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">M-x send-invisible</span></samp>&rsquo;
before typing the password itself.

     <li>Before starting the ESS process, type &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">stty -echo nl</span></samp>&rsquo;
at the unix prompt.  The &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-echo</span></samp>&rsquo; turns off the echo, the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">nl</span></samp>&rsquo; turns off the newline that you see as &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^M</span></samp>&rsquo;.

     <li>You are now talking to the unix prompt on the other machine in the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*S+3*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer.  cd into the directory for the current project and start
the ESS process by entering
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Splus</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">sas -stdio</span></samp>&rsquo;
as appropriate.  If you can login remotely to your Windows 2000, then
you should be able to run &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Sqpe</span></samp>&rsquo; on the Windows machine.  I haven't
tested this and noone has reported their tests to me.  You will not be
able to run the GUI through this text-only connection.

     <li>Once you get the S or R or SAS prompt, then you are completely connected. 
All the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">C-c C-n</span></samp>&rsquo; and related commands work correctly in sending
commands from &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfile.s</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">myfile.r</span></samp>&rsquo; on the PC to the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*S+3*</span></samp>&rsquo; buffer running the S or R or SAS program on the remote machine.

     <li>Graphics on the remote machine works fine.  If you run the X window
system on the remote unix machine you should be able to display them in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">xfree86</span></samp>&rsquo; on your PC.  If you don't run X11, then you can write
graphics to the postscript device and copy it to your PC with dired and
display it with ghostscript.

<h3 class="section">3.5 Changing the startup actions</h3>

<p>If you do not wish ESS to prompt for a starting directory when starting
a new process, set the variable <code>ess-ask-for-ess-directory</code> to
<a name="index-ess_002dask_002dfor_002dess_002ddirectory-26"></a><code>nil</code>.  In this case, the starting directory will be set using
one of the following methods:

     <ol type=1 start=1>

     <li>If the variable <code>ess-directory-function</code> stores the name of a
function, the value returned by this function is used.  The default for
this variable is nil.

     <li>Otherwise, if the variable <code>ess-directory</code> stores the name of a
directory (ending in a slash), this value is used.  The default for this
variable is nil.

     <li>Otherwise, the working directory of the current buffer is used.

        </ol>

   <p>If <code>ess-ask-for-ess-directory</code> has a non-<code>nil</code> value (as it
does by default) then the value determined by the above rules provides
the default when prompting for the starting directory.  Incidentally,
<code>ess-directory</code> is an ideal variable to set in
<code>ess-pre-run-hook</code>.

   <p>If you like to keep a record of your S sessions, set the variable
<code>ess-ask-about-transfile</code> to <code>t</code>, and you will be asked for a
filename for the transcript before the ESS process starts.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>ess-ask-about-transfile</b><var><a name="index-ess_002dask_002dabout_002dtransfile-27"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, as for a file name in which to save the session
transcript. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p><a name="index-transcript-file-28"></a>Enter the name of a file in which to save the transcript at the prompt. 
If the file doesn't exist it will be created (and you should give it a
file name ending in &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.St</span></samp>&rsquo;); if the file already exists the
transcript will be appended to the file.  (Note: if you don't set this
variable but you still want to save the transcript, you can still do it
later &mdash; see <a href="#Saving-transcripts">Saving transcripts</a>.)

   <p>Once these questions are answered (if they are asked at all) the S
process itself is started by calling the program name specified in the
variable <code>inferior-ess-program</code>. 
<a name="index-inferior_002dess_002dprogram-29"></a>If you need to pass any arguments to this program, they may be specified
in the variable <code>inferior-</code><var>S_program_name</var><code>-args</code> (e.g. if
<code>inferior-ess-program</code> is <code>"S+"</code> then the variable to set is
<code>inferior-S+-args</code>. 
<a name="index-arguments-to-S-program-30"></a>It is not normally necessary to pass arguments to the S program; in
particular do not pass the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-e</span></samp>&rsquo; option to <code>Splus</code>, since ESS
provides its own command history mechanism.

   <p>By default, the new process will be displayed in the same window in the
current frame.  If you wish your S process to appear in a separate
variable, customize the variable <code>inferior-ess-own-frame</code>. 
Alternatively, change <code>inferior-ess-same-window</code> if you wish the
process to appear within another window of the current frame.

The primary function of the ESS package is to provide an easy-to-use
front end to the S interpreter.  This is achieved by running the S
process from within an Emacs buffer, so that the Emacs editing commands
are available to correct mistakes in commands, etc.  The features of
Inferior S mode are similar to those provided by the standard Emacs
shell mode (see <a href="emacs.html#Shell-Mode">Shell Mode</a>).  Command-line completion of S objects and a number of `hot
keys' for commonly-used S commands are also provided for ease of
typing.

<p><a name="index-command_002dline-editing-34"></a>
Sending a command to the ESS process is as simple as typing it in
and pressing the &lt;RETURN&gt; key:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>RET</kbd> (<code>inferior-ess-send-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-inferior_002dess_002dsend_002dinput-35"></a>Send the command on the current line to the ESS process. 
</ul>

   <p>If you make a typing error before pressing <kbd>RET</kbd> all the usual Emacs
editing commands are available to correct it (see <a href="emacs.html#Basic">Basic</a>).  Once the
command has been corrected you can press &lt;RETURN&gt; (even if the
cursor is not at the end of the line) to send the corrected command to
the ESS process.

   <p>ESS provides some other commands which are useful for fixing mistakes:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-w</kbd> (<code>backward-kill-word</code>) <br>
<a name="index-backward_002dkill_002dword-36"></a>Deletes the previous word (such as an object name) on the command line.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-u</kbd> (<code>comint-kill-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dkill_002dinput-37"></a>Deletes everything from the prompt to point.  Use this to abandon a
command you have not yet sent to the ESS process.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> (<code>comint-bol</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dbol-38"></a>Move to the beginning of the line, and then skip forwards past the
prompt, if any. 
</ul>

commands relevant to entering input.

<h3 class="section">4.2 Completion of object names</h3>

<p><a name="index-completion-of-object-names-39"></a><a name="index-command_002dline-completion-40"></a>
In the process buffer, the &lt;TAB&gt; key is for completion, similar to
that provided by Shell Mode for filenames.  In Inferior S mode,
pressing the &lt;TAB&gt; key when the cursor is following the first few
characters of an object name <em>completes</em> the object name; if the
cursor is following a file name <kbd>TAB</kbd> completes the file name.

     <ul>
<li><kbd>TAB</kbd> (<code>comint-dynamic-complete</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002ddynamic_002dcomplete-41"></a>Complete the S object name or filename before point. 
</ul>

   <p>When the cursor is just after a partially-completed object name,
pressing &lt;TAB&gt; provides completion in a similar fashion to
<code>tcsh</code>
<a name="index-tcsh-42"></a>except that completion is performed over all known S object names
instead of file names.  ESS maintains a list of all objects known to S
at any given time, which basically consists of all objects (functions
and datasets) in every attached directory listed by the <code>search()</code>
command
<a name="index-search_0028_0029-43"></a>along with the component objects of attached data frames
<a name="index-data-frames-44"></a>(if your version of S supports them).

   <p>For example, consider the three functions (available in Splus version
3.0) called <code>binomplot()</code>, <code>binom.test()</code> and
<code>binomial()</code>.  Typing <kbd>bin TAB</kbd> after the S prompt will
insert the characters &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">om</span></samp>&rsquo;, completing the longest prefix
(&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">binom</span></samp>&rsquo;) which distinguishes these three commands.  Pressing
<kbd>TAB</kbd> once more provides a list of the three commands which have
this prefix, allowing you to add more characters (say, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.</span></samp>&rsquo;) which
specify the function you desire.  After entering more characters
pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> yet again will complete the object name up to
uniqueness, etc.  If you just wish to see what completions exist without
adding any extra characters, type <kbd>M-?</kbd>.

     <ul>
<li><kbd>M-?</kbd> (<code>ess-list-object-completions</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dlist_002dobject_002dcompletions-45"></a>List all possible completions of the object name at point. 
</ul>

   <p>ESS also provides completion over the components of named lists accessed
using the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; notation, to any level of nested lists.  This feature
is particularly useful for checking what components of a list object
exist while partway through entering a command: simply type the object
name and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo; and press <kbd>TAB</kbd> to see the names of existing list
components for that object. 
<a name="index-lists_002c-completion-on-46"></a><a name="index-completion-on-lists-47"></a>
<a name="index-completion-on-file-names-48"></a>Completion is also provided over file names, which is particularly
useful when using S functions such as <code>get()</code> or <code>scan()</code>
which require fully expanded file names.  Whenever the cursor is within
an S string, pressing <kbd>TAB</kbd> completes the file name before
point, and also expands any &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">~</span></samp>&rsquo; or environment variable references.

   <p>If the cursor is not in a string and does not follow a (partial) object
name, the &lt;TAB&gt; key has a third use: it expands history references. 
See <a href="#History-expansion">History expansion</a>.

</div>

<h3 class="section">4.3 Completion details</h3>

<p>ESS automatically keeps track of any objects added or deleted to the
system (such as new objects created, or directories added to the search
list) to make completion as accurate as possible.  Whenever ESS notices
that search list has changed
<a name="index-ess_002dchange_002dsp_002dregexp-49"></a><a rel="footnote" href="#fn-1" name="fnd-1"><sup>1</sup></a>  when you attach a directory or data
frame, the objects associated with it immediately become available for a
completion; when it is detached completion is no longer available on
those objects.

   <p>To maintain a list of accessible objects for completion, ESS needs to
determine which objects are contained in each directory or data frame on
the search list.  This is done at the start of each S session, by
running the <code>objects()</code> command on every element of the search
list.

<!-- On some systems, however, this can be rather slow; it's doubly -->
<!-- frustrating when you consider that most of the directories on the search -->
<!-- list are the standard @Sl{} libraries, which never change anyway!  When -->
<!-- ESS was installed, a database of the standard object names should have -->
<!-- been created which should speed up this process at the start of an S -->
<!-- session; if it has not been created you will get a warning like -->
<!-- `S-namedb.el does not exist'.  @xref{Installation}, for information on -->
<!-- how to create this database. -->
   <p>Efficiency in completion is gained by maintaining a cache of objects
currently known to S; when a new object becomes available or is deleted,
only one component of the cache corresponding to the associated
directory needs to be refreshed.  If ESS ever becomes confused about
what objects are available for completion (such as when if refuses to
complete an object you <strong>know</strong> is there), the command <kbd>M-x
ess-resynch</kbd>
<a name="index-ess_002dresynch-50"></a>forces the <em>entire</em> cache to be refreshed, which should fix the
problem.

<h3 class="section">4.4 Manipulating the transcript</h3>

<p>Most of the time, the cursor spends most of its time at the bottom of
the ESS process buffer, entering commands.  However all the input
and output from the current (and previous) ESS sessions is stored in
the process buffer (we call this the transcript) and often we want to
<a name="index-transcript-51"></a>move back up through the buffer, to look at the output from previous
commands for example.

   <p>Within the process buffer, a paragraph
<a name="index-paragraphs-in-the-process-buffer-52"></a>is defined as the prompt, the command after the prompt, and the output
from the command.  Thus <kbd>M-{</kbd> and <kbd>M-}</kbd> move you backwards and
forwards, respectively, through commands in the transcript.  A
particularly useful command is <kbd>M-h</kbd> (<code>mark-paragraph</code>) which
will allow you to mark a command and its entire output (for deletion,
perhaps).  For more information about paragraph commands,
see <a href="emacs.html#Paragraphs">Paragraphs</a>.

   <p>If an ESS process finishes and you restart it in the same process
buffer, the output from the new ESS process appears after the output
from the first ESS process separated by a form-feed (&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^L</span></samp>&rsquo;)
character.  Thus pages in the ESS
<a name="index-pages-in-the-process-buffer-53"></a>process buffer correspond to ESS sessions.  Thus, for example, you may
use <kbd>C-x [</kbd> and <kbd>C-x ]</kbd> to move backward and forwards through
ESS sessions in a single ESS process buffer.  For more information about
page commands, see <a href="emacs.html#Pages">Pages</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.1 Manipulating the output from the last command</h4>

<p>Viewing the output of the command you have just entered is a common
occurrence and ESS provides a number of facilities for doing this. 
<!-- Within the ESS process buffer, the variable @code{scroll-step} -->
<!-- @vindex scroll-step -->
<!-- is set to 4 (you can redefine this using @code{inferior-ess-mode-hook} -->
<!-- @vindex inferior-ess-hook -->
<!-- if you wish - @pxref{Hooks},) so that the cursor is usually near the -->
<!-- bottom of the window. -->
Whenever a command produces a longish output, it is possible that the
window will scroll, leaving the next prompt near the middle of the
window.  The first part of the command output may have scrolled off the
top of the window, even though the entire output would fit in the window
if the prompt were near the bottom of the window.  If this happens, you
can use the command

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> (<code>comint-show-maximum-output</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dshow_002dmaximum_002doutput-54"></a>Move to the end of the buffer, and place cursor on bottom line of
window. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">to make more of the last output visible.  (To make this happen
automatically for all inputs, set the variable
<code>comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-input</code> to <code>t</code>.)

   <p>If the first part of the output is still obscured, use
<a name="index-reading-long-command-outputs-55"></a>
     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> (<code>comint-show-output</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dshow_002doutput-56"></a>Moves cursor to the previous command line and and places it at the top
of the window. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">to view it.  Finally, if you want to discard the last command output
altogether, use

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-o</kbd> (<code>comint-kill-output</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dkill_002doutput-57"></a><a name="index-deleting-output-58"></a>Deletes everything from the last command to the current prompt. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">to delete it.  Use this command judiciously to keep your transcript to a
more manageable size.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.2 Viewing older commands</h4>

<p>If you want to view the output from more historic commands than the
previous command, commands are also provided to move backwards and
forwards through previously entered commands in the process buffer:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-p</kbd> (<code>comint-previous-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dprevious_002dinput-59"></a>Moves point to the preceding command in the process buffer.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd> (<code>comint-next-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dnext_002dinput-60"></a>Moves point to the next command in the process buffer. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Note that these two commands are analogous to <kbd>C-p</kbd> and <kbd>C-n</kbd>
but apply to command lines rather than text lines.  And just like
<kbd>C-p</kbd> and <kbd>C-n</kbd>, passing a prefix argument to these commands
means to move to the <var>ARG</var>'th next (or previous) command.  (These
commands are also discussed in <a href="emacs.html#Shell-History-Copying">Shell History Copying</a>.)

   <p>There are also two similar commands (not bound to any keys by default)
which move to preceding or succeeding commands, but which first prompt
for a regular expression (see <a href="emacs.html#Regexps">Syntax of Regular Expression</a>), and then moves to
the next (previous) command matching the pattern.

     <ul>
<li><code>(comint-backward-matching-input regexp arg)</code> <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dbackward_002dmatching_002dinput-61"></a><code>(comint-forward-matching-input regexp arg)</code> <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dforward_002dmatching_002dinput-62"></a>Search backward (forward) through the transcript buffer for the
<var>arg</var>'th previous (next) command matching <var>regexp</var>.  <var>arg</var>
is the prefix argument; <var>regexp</var> is prompted for in the minibuffer.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.3 Re-submitting commands from the transcript</h4>

<p>When moving through the transcript, you may wish to re-execute some of
the commands you find there.  ESS provides three commands to do this;
these commands may be used whenever the cursor is within a command line
in the transcript (if the cursor is within some command <em>output</em>,
an error is signalled).  Note all three commands involve the &lt;RETURN&gt;
key.

     <ul>
<li><kbd>RET</kbd> (<code>inferior-ess-send-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-inferior_002dess_002dsend_002dinput-63"></a>Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
execute it.

     <li><kbd>C-c RET</kbd> (<code>comint-copy-old-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dcopy_002dold_002dinput-64"></a>Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, but don't
execute it.  Leaves the cursor on the command line so that the copied
command may be edited.

     <li><kbd>M-RET</kbd> (<code>ess-transcript-send-command-and-move</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dtranscript_002dsend_002dcommand_002dand_002dmove-65"></a>Copy the command under the cursor to the current command line, and
execute it.  Moves the cursor to the following command. 
</ul>

   <p>When the cursor is not after the current prompt, the &lt;RETURN&gt; key
has a slightly different behavior than usual.  Pressing <kbd>RET</kbd> on any
line containing a command that you entered (i.e. a line beginning with a
prompt) sends that command to the ESS process once again.  If you
wish to edit the command before executing it, use <kbd>C-c RET</kbd> instead;
it copies the command to the current prompt but does not execute it,
allowing you to edit it before submitting it.

   <p>These two commands leave the cursor at the new command line, allowing
you to continue with interactive use of S.  If you wish to resubmit a
series of commands from the transcript, consider using <kbd>M-RET</kbd>
instead, which leaves the cursor at the command line following the one
you re-submitted.  Thus by using <kbd>M-RET</kbd> repeatedly, you can
re-submit a whole series of commands.

   <p>These commands work even if if the current line is a continuation line
(i.e. the prompt is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">+</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">&gt;</span></samp>&rsquo;) &mdash; in this case all
the lines that form the multi-line command are concatenated together and
the resulting command is sent to the ESS process (currently this is
the only way to resubmit a multi-line command to the ESS process in
one go).  If the current line does
<a name="index-multi_002dline-commands_002c-resubmitting-66"></a>not begin with a prompt, an error is signalled.  This feature, coupled
with the command-based motion commands described above, could be used as
a primitive history mechanism.  ESS provides a more sophisticated
mechanism, however, which is described in <a href="#Command-History">Command History</a>.

<h4 class="subsection">4.4.4 Keeping a record of your S session</h4>

<p>To keep a record of your S session in a disk file, use the Emacs
command <kbd>C-x C-w</kbd> (<code>write-file</code>) to attach a file to the
ESS process buffer.  The name of the process buffer will (probably)
change to the name of the file, but this is not a problem.  You can
still use S as usual; just remember to save the file before you quit
Emacs with <kbd>C-x C-s</kbd>.  You can make ESS prompt you for a filename in
which to save the transcript every time you start S by setting the
variable
<a name="index-ess_002dask_002dabout_002dtransfile-67"></a><code>ess-ask-about-transfile</code> to <code>t</code>; see <a href="#Customizing-startup">Customizing startup</a>. 
<a name="index-transcript-file-names-68"></a>We recommend you save your transcripts with filenames that end in
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">.St</span></samp>&rsquo;.  There is a special mode (ESS transcript mode &mdash;
see <a href="#Transcript-Mode">Transcript Mode</a>) for editing transcript files which is
automatically selected for files with this suffix.

   <p><a name="index-editing-transcripts-69"></a>S transcripts can get very large, so some judicious editing is
appropriate if you are saving it in a file.  Use <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd> whenever
a command produces excessively long output (printing large arrays, for
example).  Delete erroneous commands (and the resulting error messages
or other output) by moving to the command (or its output) and typing
<kbd>M-h C-w</kbd>.  Also, remember that <kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> (and other hot keys)
may be used for commands whose output you do not wish to appear in the
transcript.  These suggestions are appropriate even if you are not
saving your transcript to disk, since the larger the transcript, the
more memory your Emacs process will use on the host machine.

   <p>Finally, if you intend to produce S source code (suitable for using
with <code>source()</code> or inclusion in an S function) from a
transcript, then the command <kbd>M-x ess-transcript-clean-region</kbd> may
be of use. 
<a name="index-ess_002dtranscript_002dclean_002dregion-70"></a>This command works in any Emacs buffer, and removes all prompts and
command output from an ESS transcript within the current region, leaving
only the commands.  Don't forget to remove any erroneous commands first!

<h3 class="section">4.5 Command History</h3>

<p><a name="index-command-history-71"></a><a name="index-editing-commands-72"></a><a name="index-re_002dexecuting-commands-73"></a>
ESS provides easy-to-use facilities for re-executing or editing previous
commands.  An input history of the last few commands is maintained (by
default the last 50 commands are stored, although this can be changed by
setting the variable <code>comint-input-ring-size</code> in
<a name="index-comint_002dinput_002dring_002dsize-74"></a><code>inferior-ess-mode-hook</code>.) The simplest history commands simply
select the next and previous commands in the input history:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>M-p</kbd> (<code>comint-previous-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dprevious_002dinput-75"></a>Select the previous command in the input history.

     <li><kbd>M-n</kbd>  (<code>comint-next-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dnext_002dinput-76"></a>Select the next command in the input history. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">For example, pressing <kbd>M-p</kbd> once will re-enter the last command into
the process buffer after the prompt but does not send it to the ESS
process, thus allowing editing or correction of the command before the
ESS process sees it.  Once corrections have been made, press
<kbd>RET</kbd> to send the edited command to the ESS process.

   <p>If you want to select a particular command from the history by matching
it against a regular expression (see <a href="emacs.html#Regexps">Syntax of Regular Expression</a>), to search for a
particular variable name for example, these commands are also available:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>M-r</kbd> (<code>comint-previous-matching-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dprevious_002dmatching_002dinput-77"></a>Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the input
history for a command matching the expression.

     <li><kbd>M-s</kbd> (<code>comint-next-matching-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dnext_002dmatching_002dinput-78"></a>Prompt for a regular expression, and search backwards through the input
history for a command matching the expression. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">A common type of search is to find the last command that began with a
particular sequence of characters; the following two commands provide an
easy way to do this:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>A-M-r</kbd> (<code>comint-previous-matching-input-from-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dprevious_002dmatching_002dinput_002dfrom_002dinput-79"></a>Select the previous command in the history which matches the string
typed so far.

     <li><kbd>A-M-s</kbd> (<code>comint-next-matching-input-from-input</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dnext_002dmatching_002dinput_002dfrom_002dinput-80"></a>Select the next command in the history which matches the string typed so
far. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Instead of prompting for a regular expression to match against, as they
instead select commands starting with those characters already entered. 
For instance, if you wanted to re-execute the last <code>attach()</code>
command, you may only need to type <kbd>att</kbd> and then <kbd>A-M-r</kbd> and
<kbd>RET</kbd>.  (Note: you may not have an &lt;ALT&gt; key on your keyboard,
in which case it may be a good idea to bind these commands to some other
keys.)

   <p>See <a href="emacs.html#Shell-Ring">Shell History Ring</a>, for a more detailed discussion of the history mechanism.

</div>

<h3 class="section">4.6 References to historical commands</h3>

<p>Instead of searching through the command history using the command
described in the previous section, you can alternatively refer to a
historical command directly using a notation very similar to that used
in <code>csh</code>.  History references are introduced by a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; or
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; character and have meanings as follows:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The immediately previous command

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!-</span><var>N</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The <var>N</var>th previous command

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!text</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The last command beginning with the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">text</span></samp>&rsquo;

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!?text</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The last command containing the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">text</span></samp>&rsquo;
</dl>

   <p>In addition, you may follow the reference with a <dfn>word designator</dfn>
to select particular <dfn>words</dfn> of the input.  A word is defined as a
sequence of characters separated by whitespace.  (You can modify this
definition by setting the value of <code>comint-delimiter-argument-list</code>
to a list of characters that are allowed to separate words and
<a name="index-comint_002ddelimiter_002dargument_002dlist-81"></a>themselves form words.)  Words are numbered beginning with zero.  The
word designator usually begins with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">:</span></samp>&rsquo; (colon) character;
however it may be omitted if the word reference begins with a &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;.  If the word is to be selected from the
previous command, the second &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo;  character can be omitted from the
event specification.  For instance, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!:1</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!:1</span></samp>&rsquo; both
refer to the first word of the previous command, while &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!!$</span></samp>&rsquo; and
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!$</span></samp>&rsquo; both refer to the last word in the previous command.  The
format of word designators is as follows:

     <dl>
<dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The zeroth word (i.e. the first one on the command line)

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>n</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The <var>n</var>th word, where <var>n</var> is a number

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The first word (i.e. the second one on the command line)

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">$</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>The last word

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">-</span><var>y</var></samp>&rsquo;<dd>A range of words; &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">-</span><var>y</var></samp>&rsquo; abbreviates &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">0-</span><var>y</var></samp>&rsquo;

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>All the words except the zeroth word, or nothing if the command had just
one word (the zeroth)

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Abbreviates <var>x</var>-$

     <br><dt>&lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">-</span></samp>&rsquo;<dd>Like &lsquo;<samp><var>x</var><span class="samp">*</span></samp>&rsquo;, but omitting the last word
</dl>

   <p>In addition, you may surround the entire reference except for the first
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">!</span></samp>&rsquo; by braces to allow it to be followed by other (non-whitespace)
characters (which will be appended to the expanded reference).

   <p>Finally, ESS also provides quick substitution; a reference like
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^old^new^</span></samp>&rsquo; means &ldquo;the last command, but with the first occurrence
of the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">old</span></samp>&rsquo; replaced with the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">new</span></samp>&rsquo;&rdquo; (the last
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is optional).  Similarly, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^old^</span></samp>&rsquo; means &ldquo;the last
command, with the first occurrence of the string &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">old</span></samp>&rsquo; deleted&rdquo;
(again, the last &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">^</span></samp>&rsquo; is optional).

   <p>To convert a history reference as described above to an input suitable
for S, you need to <dfn>expand</dfn> the history reference, using the
&lt;TAB&gt; key.  For this to work, the cursor must be preceded by a space
(otherwise it would try to complete an object name) and not be within a
string (otherwise it would try to complete a filename).  So to expand
the history reference, type <kbd>SPC TAB</kbd>.  This will convert the
history reference into an S command from the history, which you can
then edit or press &lt;RET&gt; to execute.

   <p>For example, to execute the last command that referenced the variable
<code>data</code>, type <kbd>!?data SPC TAB RET</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">4.7 Hot keys for common commands</h3>

<p>ESS provides a number of commands for executing the commonly used
functions.  These commands below are basically information-gaining
commands (such as <code>objects()</code> or <code>search()</code>) which tend to
clutter up your transcript and for this reason some of the hot keys
display their output in a temporary buffer instead of the process buffer
by default.  This behavior is controlled by the variable
<code>ess-execute-in-process-buffer</code> which, if
<a name="index-ess_002dexecute_002din_002dprocess_002dbuffer-82"></a>non-<code>nil</code>, means that these commands will produce their output in
the process buffer instead.  In any case, passing a prefix argument to
the commands (with <kbd>C-u</kbd>) will reverse the meaning of
<code>ess-execute-in-process-buffer</code> for that command, i.e. the output
will be displayed in the process buffer if it usually goes to a
temporary buffer, and vice-versa.  These are the hot keys that behave in
this way:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-x</kbd> (<code>ess-execute-objects</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dexecute_002dobjects-83"></a>Sends the <code>objects()</code>
<a name="index-objects_0028_0029-84"></a>command to the ESS process.  A prefix argument specifies the
position on the search list (use a negative argument to toggle
<code>ess-execute-in-process-buffer</code> as well).  A quick way to see what
objects are in your working directory. 
<a name="index-objects-85"></a><a name="index-objects_0028_0029-86"></a>
<li><kbd>C-c C-s</kbd> (<code>ess-execute-search</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dexecute_002dsearch-87"></a>Sends the <code>search()</code>
<a name="index-search_0028_0029-88"></a>command to the ESS process. 
<a name="index-search-list-89"></a><a name="index-search_0028_0029-90"></a>
<li><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd> (<code>ess-execute</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dexecute-91"></a>Prompt for an ESS expression, and evaluate it. 
</ul>

   <p><code>ess-execute</code> may seem pointless when you could just type the
command in anyway, but it proves useful for `spot' calculations which
would otherwise clutter your transcript, or for evaluating an expression
while partway through entering a command.  You can also use this command
to generate new hot keys using the Emacs keyboard macro facilities;
see <a href="emacs.html#Keyboard-Macros">Keyboard Macros</a>. 
<a name="index-hot-keys-92"></a><a name="index-keyboard-short-cuts-93"></a>
The following hot keys do not use <code>ess-execute-in-process-buffer</code>
to decide where to display the output &mdash; they either always display in
the process buffer or in a separate buffer, as indicated:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-a</kbd> (<code>ess-execute-attach</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dexecute_002dattach-94"></a>Prompts for a directory to attach to the ESS process with the
<code>attach()</code> command. 
<a name="index-attach_0028_0029-95"></a>If a numeric prefix argument is given it is used as the position on the
search list to attach the directory; otherwise the S default of 2 is
used.  The <code>attach()</code> command actually executed appears in the
process buffer.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> (<code>ess-load-file</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dload_002dfile-96"></a>Prompts for a file to load into the ESS process using
<code>source()</code>.  If there is an error during loading, you can jump to
the error in the file with <kbd>C-x `</kbd> (<code>ess-parse-errors</code>). 
<a name="index-ess_002dparse_002derrors-97"></a>See <a href="#Error-Checking">Error Checking</a>, for more details.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> (<code>ess-display-help-on-object</code>) <br> Pops up a help
buffer for an S object or function.  See <a href="#Help">Help</a> for more
details.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-q</kbd> (<code>ess-quit</code>) <br>
<a name="index-quitting-from-ESS-98"></a><a name="index-killing-the-ESS-process-99"></a>Sends the <code>q()</code>
<a name="index-q_0028_0029-100"></a>command to the ESS process (or <code>(exit)</code>
<a name="index-exit_0028_0029-101"></a>to the <b>XLS</b> process), and cleans up any temporary buffers (such as
help buffers or edit buffers) you may have created along the way.  Use
this command when you have finished your S session instead of simply
typing <code>q()</code> yourself, otherwise you will need to issue the command
<kbd>M-x ess-cleanup</kbd>
<a name="index-ess_002dcleanup-102"></a><a name="index-cleaning-up-103"></a><a name="index-temporary-buffers_002c-killing-104"></a><a name="index-killing-temporary-buffers-105"></a>command explicitly to make sure that all the files that need to be saved
have been saved, and that all the temporary buffers have been killed. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">4.8 Is the Statistical Process running under ESS?</h3>

<p><a name="index-STERM-106"></a><a name="index-STERM-107"></a>For the S languages (S, S-Plus, R) ESS sets an option in the current
process that programs in the language can check to determine the
environment in which they are currently running.

   <p>ESS sets
<code>options(STERM="iESS")</code> for S language processes running in an
inferior <code>i<acronym>ESS[S]</acronym><!-- /@w --></code> or <code>i<acronym&nbsp;title="[S]">ESS[R]</acronym><!-- /@w --></code> buffer.

   <p>ESS sets
<code>options(STERM="ddeESS")</code> for independent S-Plus for Windows
processes running in the GUI and communicating with ESS via
the DDE (Microsoft Dynamic Data Exchange) protocol through a
<code>ddeESS[S]</code> buffer.

   <p>Other values of <code>options()$STERM</code> that we recommend are:

     <ul>
<li><code>length</code>:     Fixed length xterm or telnet window. 
<li><code>scrollable</code>: Unlimited length xterm or telnet window. 
<li><code>server</code>:     S-Plus Stat Server. 
<li><code>BATCH</code>:      BATCH. 
<li><code>Rgui</code>:       R GUI. 
<li><code>Commands</code>:   S-Plus GUI without DDE interface to ESS. 
</ul>

   <p>Additional values may be recommended in the future as new interaction
protocols are created.  Unlike the values <code>iESS</code> and <code>ddeESS</code>,
ESS can't set these other values since the S language program is not
under the control of ESS.

<h3 class="section">4.9 Using emacsclient</h3>

<p><a name="index-emacsclient-108"></a>
When starting R or S under Unix, ESS sets
<code>options(editor="emacsclient")</code>.  (Under Microsoft Windows, it will
use gnuclient.exe rather than emacsclient, but the same principle
applies.)  Within your R session, for example, if you have a function
called <code>iterator</code>, typing <code>fix(iterator)</code>, will show that
function in a temporary Emacs buffer.  You can then correct the
function.  When you kill the buffer, the definition of the function is
updated.  Using <code>edit()</code> rather than <code>fix()</code> means that the
function is not updated.  Finally, the S function <code>page(x)</code> will
also show a text representation of the object <code>x</code> in a temporary
Emacs buffer.

<h3 class="section">4.10 Other commands provided by inferior-ESS</h3>

<p>The following commands are also provided in the process buffer:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> (<code>comint-interrupt-subjob</code>) <br>
<a name="index-comint_002dinterrupt_002dsubjob-109"></a>Sends a Control-C signal to the ESS process.  This has the effect of
<a name="index-aborting-S-commands-110"></a><a name="index-interrupting-S-commands-111"></a>aborting the current command.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> (<code>ess-abort</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dabort-112"></a><a name="index-comint_002dstop_002dsubjob-113"></a>Sends a STOP signal to the ESS process, killing it immediately. 
It's not a good idea to use this, in general: Neither <code>q()</code> nor
<code>.Last</code> will be executed and device drivers will not finish
cleanly.  This command is provided as a safety to
<code>comint-stop-subjob</code>, which is usually bound to <kbd>C-c C-z</kbd>.  If
you want to quit from S, use <kbd>C-c C-q</kbd> (<code>ess-quit</code>) instead. 
<a name="index-ess_002dquit-114"></a><a name="index-aborting-the-ESS-process-115"></a>

<h2 class="chapter">5 Manipulating saved transcript files</h2>

<p>Inferior S mode records the transcript (the list of all commands
executed, and their output) in the process buffer, which can be saved as
a <dfn>transcript file</dfn>, which should normally have the suffix
<samp><span class="file">.St</span></samp>.  The most obvious use for a transcript file is as a static
record of the actions you have performed in a particular S session. 
Sometimes, however, you may wish to re-execute commands recorded in the
transcript file by submitting them to a running ESS process.  This
is what Transcript Mode is for.

   <p>If you load file a with the suffix <samp><span class="file">.St</span></samp> into Emacs, it is placed
in S Transcript Mode.  Transcript Mode is similar to Inferior S mode
(see <a href="#Entering-commands">Entering commands</a>):
<a name="index-transcript-mode-motion-117"></a><a name="index-motion-in-transcript-mode-118"></a>paragraphs are defined as a command and its output, and you can move
though commands either with the paragraph commands or with <kbd>C-c C-p</kbd>
and <kbd>C-c C-n</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">5.1 Resubmitting commands from the transcript file</h3>

<p>Three commands are provided to re-submit command lines from the
transcript file to a running ESS process.  They are:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>RET</kbd> (<code>ess-transcript-send-command</code>) <br>
Send the current command line to the ESS process, and execute it. 
<a name="index-ess_002dtranscript_002dsend_002dcommand-119"></a>
<li><kbd>C-c RET</kbd> (<code>ess-transcript-copy-command</code>) <br>
Copy the current command to the ESS process, and switch to the
ESS process buffer (ready to edit the copied command). 
<a name="index-ess_002dtranscript_002dcopy_002dcommand-120"></a>
<li><kbd>M-RET</kbd> (<code>ess-transcript-send-command-and-move</code>) <br>
Send the current command to the ESS process, and move to the next
command line.  This command is useful for submitting a series of
commands. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">Note that these commands are similar to those on the same keys in
Inferior S Mode.  In all three cases, the commands should be
executed when the cursor is on a command line in the transcript; the
prompt is automatically removed before the command is submitted.

<h3 class="section">5.2 Cleaning transcript files</h3>

<p>Yet another use for transcript files is to extract the command lines for
inclusion in an S source file or function.  Transcript mode provides
one command which does just this:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-w</kbd> (<code>ess-transcript-clean-region</code>) <br>
Deletes all prompts and command output in the region, leaving only the
commands themselves. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">The remaining command lines may then be copied to a source file or edit
buffer for inclusion in a function definition, or may be evaluated
directly (see <a href="#Evaluating-code">Evaluating code</a>) using the code evaluation commands
from S mode, also available in S Transcript Mode.

<h3 class="section">6.1 ESS[S]&ndash;Editing files</h3>

<p><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> is the mode for editing S language files.  This mode handles:

     <ul>
<li> proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return]. 
<li> color and font choices based on syntax. 
<li> ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted
  region, an S function, or a single line to an inferior S process, if
  one is currently running. 
<li> ability to switch between processes which would be the target of the
  buffer (for the above). 
<li> The ability to request help from an S process for variables and
  functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer. 
<li> completion of object names and file names. 
</ul>

   <p><acronym>ESS[S]</acronym> mode should be automatically turned on when loading a file with
the suffices found in ess-site (*.R, *.S, *.s, etc).  However, one
will have to start up an inferior process to take advantage of the
interactive features.

<h3 class="section">6.2 iESS[S]&ndash;Inferior ESS processes</h3>

<p>iESS (inferior ESS) is the mode for interfacing with active
statistical processes (programs).  This mode handles:

     <ul>
<li> proper indenting, generated by both [Tab] and [Return]. 
<li> color and font highlighting based on syntax. 
<li> ability to resubmit the contents of a multi-line command
 to the executing process with a single keystroke [RET]. 
<li> The ability to request help from the current process for variables
 and functions, and to have the results sent into a separate buffer. 
<li> completion of object names and file names. 
<li> interactive history mechanism. 
<li> transcript recording and editing. 
</ul>

   <p>To start up iESS mode, use:
<pre class="example">        M-x S+3
        M-x S4
        M-x S+5
        M-x S+6
        M-x R
</pre>
   <p>(for S-PLUS 3.x, S4, S+5, S+6 or S+7, and R, respectively.  This assumes that
you have access to each).  Usually the site will have defined one of
these programs (by default S+6) to the simpler name:

   <p>M-x S

   <p><a name="index-command-line-arguments-121"></a>In the (rare) case that you wish to pass command line arguments to the
starting S+6 process, set the variable <code>inferior-Splus-args</code>.

   <p>Note that R has some extremely useful command line arguments.  For
example, <code>--vanilla</code> will ensure R starts up without loading in any init
files.  To enter a command line argument, call R using a "prefix
argument", by

   <p>C-u M-x R

   <p>and when ESS prompts for "Starting Args ? ", enter (for example):

   <p><code>--vanilla</code>

   <p>Then that R process will be started up using <code>R --vanilla</code>.  If you
wish to always call R with certain arguments, set the variable
<code>inferior-R-args</code> accordingly.

<!-- Menubar access to other versions of R and Sqpe -->
   <p>If you have other versions of R or S-Plus available on the system, ESS
is also able to start those versions.  How this works depend on which OS
you are using:

   <p>R on Unix systems:
If you have "R-1.8.1" on
your `exec-path', it can be started using <kbd>M-x R-1.8.1</kbd>.  By
default, ESS will find versions of R beginning "R-1" or "R-2".  If your
versions of R are called other names, consider renaming them with a
symbolic link or change the variable <code>ess-r-versions</code>.  To see
which defuns have been created for starting different versions of R,
type <kbd>M-x R-</kbd> and then hit [Tab].  You will then see if any defuns
for particular versions of R have been created.  These other versions of
R can also be started from the "ESS-&gt;Start Process-&gt;Other" menu.

   <p>R on Windows systems:
If you have "rw1081" on
your `exec-path', it can be started using <kbd>M-x rw1081</kbd>.  By
default, ESS will find versions of R located in directories
parallel to the version of R in your <code>PATH</code>.  If your
versions of R are called other names, you will need to change the variable
<code>ess-rterm-versions</code>.  To see
which defuns have been created for starting different versions of R,
type <kbd>M-x rw</kbd> and then hit [Tab].  You will then see if any defuns
for particular versions of R have been created.  These other versions of
R can also be started from the "ESS-&gt;Start Process-&gt;Other" menu.

   <p>Once ESS has found these extra versions of R, it will then create a new
defun, called <kbd>M-x R-newest</kbd>, which will call the newest version of
R that it found.  (ESS examines the date in the first line of
information from <code>R --version</code> to determine which is newest.)

   <p>S on Unix systems: If you have "Splus7" on your `exec-path', it can be
started using <kbd>M-x Splus7</kbd>.  By default, ESS will find all
executables beginning "Splus" on your path.  If your versions of S are
called other names, consider renaming them with a symbolic link or
change the variable <code>ess-s-versions</code>.  To see which defuns have
been created for starting different versions of Splus, type <kbd>M-x
Splus</kbd> and then hit [Tab].  You will then see if any defuns for
particular versions of Splus have been created.  These other versions of
Splus can also be started from the "ESS-&gt;Start Process-&gt;Other" menu.

   <p>A second mechanim is also available for running other versions of Splus. 
The variable <code>ess-s-versions-list</code> is a list of lists; each sublist
should be of the form: (DEFUN-NAME PATH ARGS).  DEFUN-NAME is the name
of the new emacs function you wish to create to start the new S process;
PATH is the full path to the version of S you want to run; ARGS is an
optional string of command-line arguments to pass to the S process. 
Here is an example setting:
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-s-versions-list
           '( ("Splus64" "/usr/local/bin/Splus64")
              ("Splus64-j" "/usr/local/bin/Splus64" "-j")))
</pre>
   <p>which will then allow you to do <kbd>M-x Splus64-j</kbd> to start  Splus64
with the corresponding command line arguments.

   <p>If you change the value of either <code>ess-s-versions</code> or
<code>ess-s-versions-list</code>, you should put them in your .emacs before
ess-site is loaded, since the new emacs functions are created when ESS
is loaded.

   <p>Sqpe (S-Plus running inside an emacs buffer) on Windows systems:
If you have an older version of S-Plus (S-Plus 6.1 for example) on your system,
ir can be started inside an emacs buffer with <kbd>M-x splus61</kbd>.  By
default, ESS will find versions of S-Plus located in the installation
directories that Insightful uses by default.  If your
versions of S-Plus are anywhere else, you will need to change the variable
<code>ess-SHOME-versions</code>.  To see
which defuns have been created for starting different versions of S-Plus,
type <kbd>M-x spl</kbd> and then hit [Tab].  You will then see if any defuns
for particular versions of S-Plus have been created.  These other versions of
S-Plus can also be started from the "ESS-&gt;Start Process-&gt;Other" menu.

<p>The first is preferred, and configured for.  The second one can be
retrieved again, by changing emacs variables.

   <p>1: (preferred by the current group of developers):  The source code is
   real.  The objects are realizations of the source code.  Source
   for EVERY user modified object is placed in a particular directory
   or directories, for later editing and retrieval.

   <p>2: (older version): S objects are real.  Source code is a temporary
   realization of the objects.  Dumped buffers should not be saved. 
   _We_strongly_discourage_this_approach_.  However, if you insist,
   add the following lines to your .emacs file:
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-keep-dump-files 'nil)
     (setq ess-delete-dump-files t)
     (setq ess-mode-silently-save nil)
</pre>
   <p>The second saves a small amount of disk space.  The first allows for
better portability as well as external version control for code.

possible.  Contributions of examples of how you work with ESS are
appreciated (especially since it helps us determine priorities on
future enhancements)! (comments as to what should be happening are
prefixed by "##").

<h3 class="section">6.6 Customization Examples and Solutions to Problems</h3>

<p>1. Suppose that you are primarily an SPLUS 3.4 user, occasionally
   using S version 4, and sick and tired of the buffer-name *S+3*
   we've stuck you with.  Simply edit the "ess-dialect" alist entry in
   the essd-sp3.el and essd-s4.el files to be "S" instead of "S4" and
   "S+3".  This will ensure that all the inferior process buffer names
   are "*S*".

   <p>2. Suppose that you WANT to have the first buffer name indexed by
   ":1", in the same manner as your S-PLUS processes 2,3,4, and 5 (for
   you heavy simulation people).  Then uncomment the line in ess-site
   (or add after your (require 'ess-site) or (load "ess-site") command
    in your .emacs file, the line:
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-plain-first-buffername nil)
</pre>
   <p>)

   <p>3. Fontlocking sometimes fails to behave nicely upon errors.  When
   Splus dumps, a mis-matched "  (double-quote) can result in the
   wrong font-lock face being used for the remainder of the buffer.

   <p>Solution: add a " at the end of the "Dumped..." statement, to
   revert the font-lock face back to normal.

   <p>4. When you change directory within a *R* or *S* session using the
setwd() command, emacs does not recognise that you have changed the
current directory.

   <p>Solution: Use <kbd>M-x ess-change-directory</kbd>.  This will
ensure that Emacs will know that you have changed the directory, and
update the emacs variable <code>default-directory</code>.

<h2 class="chapter">7 Editing S functions</h2>

<p><a name="index-editing-functions-122"></a>ESS provides facilities for editing S objects within your Emacs
session.  Most editing is performed on S functions, although in
theory you may edit datasets as well.  Edit buffers are always
associated with files, although you may choose to make these files
temporary if you wish.  Alternatively, you may make use of a simple yet
powerful mechanism for maintaining backups of text representations of
S functions.  Error-checking is performed when S code is loaded
into the ESS process.

<h3 class="section">7.1 Creating or modifying S objects</h3>

<p><a name="index-edit-buffer-123"></a>
To edit an S object, type

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> (<code>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002ddump_002dobject_002dinto_002dedit_002dbuffer-124"></a>Edit an S object in its own edit buffer. 
</ul>

   <p>from within the ESS process buffer (<code>*S*</code>).  You will then be
prompted for an object to edit: you may either type in the name of an
existing object (for which completion is available using the <kbd>TAB</kbd>
key),
<a name="index-completion_002c-when-prompted-for-object-names-125"></a>or you may enter the name of a new object. 
<a name="index-creating-new-objects-126"></a><a name="index-new-objects_002c-creating-127"></a>A buffer will be created containing the text representation of the
requested object or, if you entered the name of a non-existent object at
the prompt and the variable <code>ess-function-template</code>
<a name="index-ess_002dfunction_002dtemplate-128"></a>is non-<code>nil</code>, you will be presented with a template defined by that
variable, which defaults to a skeleton function construct.

   <p>You may then edit the function as required.  The edit buffer generated
by <code>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</code> is placed in the <code>ESS</code>
major mode which provides a number of commands to facilitate editing
S source code.  Commands are provided to intelligently indent S
code, evaluate portions of S code and to move around S code
constructs.

   <p><a name="index-dump-files-129"></a><a name="index-reverting-function-definitions-130"></a>Note: when you dump a file with <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>, ESS first checks
to see whether there already exists an edit buffer containing that
object and, if so, pops you directly to that buffer.  If not, ESS next
checks whether there is a file in the appropriate place with the
appropriate name (see <a href="#Source-Files">Source Files</a>) and if so, reads in that file. 
You can use this facility to return to an object you were editing in a
previous session (and which possibly was never loaded to the S
session).  Finally, if both these tests fail, the ESS process is
consulted and a <code>dump()</code> command issued. 
<a name="index-dump_0028_0029-131"></a>If you want to force ESS to ask the ESS process for the object's
definition (say, to reformat an unmodified buffer or to revert back to
S's idea of the object's definition) pass a prefix argument to
<code>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</code> by typing <kbd>C-u C-c C-d</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">7.2 Loading source files into the ESS process</h3>

<p>The best way to get information &mdash; particularly function definitions
&mdash; into S is to load them in as source file, using S's
<code>source</code> function.  You have already seen how to create source
files using <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>; ESS provides a complementary command for
loading source files (even files not created with ESS!) into the ESS
process:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> (<code>ess-load-file</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dload_002dfile-132"></a>Loads a file into the ESS process using <code>source()</code>. 
<a name="index-source_0028_0029-133"></a></ul>

<p class="noindent">After typing <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> you will prompted for the name of the file to
load into S; usually this is the current buffer's file which is the
default value (selected by simply pressing <kbd>RET</kbd> at the prompt). 
You will be asked to save the buffer first if it has been modified (this
happens automatically if the buffer was generated with <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>). 
The file will then be loaded, and if it loads successfully you will be
returned to the ESS process.

<h3 class="section">7.3 Detecting errors in source files</h3>

<p><a name="index-errors-134"></a><a name="index-parsing-errors-135"></a>If any errors occur when loading a file with <code>C-c C-l</code>, ESS will
inform you of this fact.  In this case, you can jump directly to the
line in the source file which caused the error by typing <kbd>C-c `</kbd>
(<code>ess-parse-errors</code>). 
<a name="index-ess_002dparse_002derrors-136"></a>You will be returned to the offending file (loading it into a buffer if
necessary) with point at the line S reported as containing the
error.  You may then correct the error, and reload the file.  Note that
none of the commands in an S source file will take effect if any
part of the file contains errors.

   <p>Sometimes the error is not caused by a syntax error (loading a
non-existent file for example). In this case typing <kbd>C-c `</kbd> will
simply display a buffer containing S's error message.  You can force
this behavior (and avoid jumping to the file when there <em>is</em> a
syntax error) by passing a prefix argument to <code>ess-parse-errors</code>
with <kbd>C-u C-c `</kbd>.

<h3 class="section">7.4 Sending code to the ESS process</h3>

<p>Other commands are also available for evaluating portions of code in the
S process.  These commands cause the selected code to be evaluated
directly by the ESS process as if you had typed them in at the
command line; the <code>source()</code> function is not used.  You may choose
whether both the commands and their output appear in the process buffer
(as if you had typed in the commands yourself) or if the output alone is
echoed.  The behavior is controlled by the variable
<code>ess-eval-visibly-p</code> whose default is <code>nil</code>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dvisibly_002dp-137"></a>(display output only).  Passing a prefix argument (<kbd>C-u</kbd>) to any of
the following commands, however, reverses the meaning of
<code>ess-eval-visibly-p</code> for that command only &mdash; for example <kbd>C-u
C-c C-j</kbd> echoes the current line of S (or other) code in the ESS
process buffer, followed by its output.  This method of evaluation is an
alternative to S's <code>source()</code> function
<a name="index-source_0028_0029-138"></a><a name="index-echoing-commands-when-evaluating-139"></a><a name="index-evaluating-code-with-echoed-commands-140"></a>when you want the input as well as the output to be displayed.  (You can
sort of do this with <code>source()</code> when the option <code>echo=T</code> is
set, except that prompts do not get displayed.  ESS puts prompts in the
right places.) The commands for evaluating code are:

     
<a name="index-evaluating-S-expressions-141"></a>
<ul><li><kbd>C-c C-j</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-line</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dline-142"></a>Send the line containing point to the ESS process.

     <li><kbd>C-c M-j</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-line-and-go</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dline_002dand_002dgo-143"></a>As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> or <kbd>ESC C-x</kbd> (aka <kbd>M-C-x</kbd>) (<code>ess-eval-function</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dfunction-144"></a>Send the S function containing point to the ESS process.

     <li><kbd>C-c M-f</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-function-and-go</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dfunction_002dand_002dgo-145"></a>As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-r</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-region</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dregion-146"></a>Send the text between point and mark to the ESS process.

     <li><kbd>C-c M-r</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-region-and-go</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dregion_002dand_002dgo-147"></a>As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-b</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-buffer</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dbuffer-148"></a>Send the contents of the edit buffer to the ESS process.

     <li><kbd>C-c M-b</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-buffer-and-go</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dfunction_002dand_002dgo-149"></a>As above, but returns you to the ESS process buffer as well.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-n</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-line-and-step</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dline_002dand_002dstep-150"></a><a name="index-stepping-through-code-151"></a><a name="index-debugging-S-functions-152"></a>Sends the current line to the ESS process, echoing it in the process
buffer, and moves point to the next line.  Useful when debugging for
stepping through your code. 
</ul>

   <p>It should be stressed once again that these <code>ess-eval-</code> commands
should only be used for evaluating small portions of code for debugging
purposes, or for generating transcripts from source files.  When editing
S functions, <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> is the command to use to update the
function's value.  In particular, <code>ess-eval-buffer</code> is now largely
obsolete.

   <p>One final command is provided for spot-evaluations of S code:

     <ul>
<kbd>C-c C-t</kbd> (<code>ess-execute-in-tb</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dexecute_002din_002dtb-153"></a>Prompt for an S expression and evaluate it.  Displays result in a
temporary buffer. 
</ul>

<p class="noindent">This is useful for quick calculations, etc.

   <p>All the above commands are useful for evaluating small amounts of code
and observing the results in the process buffer.  A useful way to work
is to divide the frame into two windows; one containing the source code
and the other containing the process buffer.  If you wish to make the
process buffer scroll automatically when the output reaches the bottom
of the window, you will need to set the variable
<code>comint-scroll-to-bottom-on-output</code> to <code>'others</code> or <code>t</code>.

<h3 class="section">7.5 Indenting and formatting S code</h3>

<p>ESS now provides a sophisticated mechanism for indenting S source
code (thanks to Ken'ichi Shibayama).  Compound statements (delimited by
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">{</span></samp>&rsquo; and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">}</span></samp>&rsquo;) are indented relative to their enclosing block. 
In addition, the braces have been electrified to automatically indent to
the correct position when inserted, and optionally insert a newline at
the appropriate place as well.  Lines which continue an incomplete
expression are indented relative to the first line of the expression. 
Function definitions, <code>if</code> statements, calls to <code>expression()</code>
and loop constructs are all recognized and indented appropriately.  User
variables are provided to control the amount if indentation in each
case, and there are also a number of predefined indentation styles to
choose from.

   <p><a name="index-comments-in-S-154"></a>Comments are also handled specially by ESS, using an idea borrowed from
the Emacs-Lisp indentation style.  By default,
comments beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">###</span></samp>&rsquo;
are aligned to the beginning of the line.  Comments beginning with
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">##</span></samp>&rsquo; are aligned to the current level of indentation for the block
containing the comment.  Finally, comments beginning with &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">#</span></samp>&rsquo; are
aligned to a column on the right (the 40th column by default, but this
value is controlled by the variable <code>comment-column</code>,)
<a name="index-comment_002dcolumn-155"></a>or just after the expression on the line containing the comment if it
extends beyond the indentation column.  You turn off the default
behavior by adding the line
<code>(setq ess-fancy-comments nil)</code> to your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file. 
<a name="index-ess_002dfancy_002dcomments-156"></a>
<a name="index-roxygen-157"></a>ESS now has preliminary support for editing roxygen tags within R mode
buffers.  In particular, when the function <code>ess-roxygen-fn</code> (bound
to <kbd>C-c C-o</kbd>) is called with point inside a R function, the roxygen
template for the function is added just above the function.

   <p>The indentation commands provided by ESS are:
<a name="index-indenting-158"></a><a name="index-formatting-source-code-159"></a>
     <ul>
<li><kbd>TAB</kbd> (<code>ess-indent-command</code>) <br>
Indents the current line as S code.  If a prefix argument is given,
all following lines which are part of the same (compound) expression are
indented by the same amount (but relative indents are preserved).

     <li><kbd>RET</kbd> (<code>newline-and-indent</code>) <br>
<kbd>LFD</kbd> (<em>newline-and-indent</em>) <br>
Insert a newline, and indent the next line.  (Note that most keyboards
nowadays do not have a &lt;LINEFEED&gt; key, but <kbd>C-j</kbd> is equivalent.)

     <li><kbd>ESC C-q</kbd> aka <kbd>M-C-q</kbd> aka <kbd>C-M-q</kbd> (<code>ess-indent-exp</code>) <br>
Indents each line in the S (compound) expression which follows point. 
Very useful for beautifying your S code.

     <li><kbd>{</kbd> and <kbd>}</kbd> (<code>ess-electric-brace</code>) <br>
The braces automatically indent to the correct position when typed.

     <li><kbd>M-;</kbd> (<code>indent-for-comment</code>) <br>
Indents an existing comment line appropriately, or inserts an
appropriate comment marker.

     <li><kbd>M-x ess-set-style</kbd> <br>
Set the formatting style in this buffer to be one of the predefined
styles: <code>GNU</code>, <code>BSD</code>, <code>K&amp;R</code>, <code>CLB</code>, and <code>C++</code>. 
The <code>DEFAULT</code> style uses the default values for the indenting
variables (unless they have been modified in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.) 
<a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-file-160"></a>This command causes all of the formatting variables to be buffer-local.

<h3 class="section">7.6 Commands for motion, completion and more</h3>

<p>A number of commands are provided to move across function definitions
in the edit buffer:
     <ul>
<li><kbd>ESC C-a</kbd> aka <kbd>C-M-a</kbd> (<code>ess-beginning-of-function</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dbeginning_002dof_002dfunction-161"></a>Moves point to the beginning of the function containing point.

     <li><kbd>ESC C-e</kbd> aka <kbd>C-M-e</kbd> (<code>ess-end-of-function</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dend_002dof_002dfunction-162"></a>Moves point to the end of the function containing point.

     <li><kbd>ESC C-h</kbd> aka <kbd>C-M-h</kbd> (<code>ess-mark-function</code>) <br>
Places point at the beginning of the S function containing point, and
mark at the end. 
</ul>
   Don't forget the usual Emacs commands for moving over balanced
expressions and parentheses: See <a href="Emacs.html#Lists">Lists and Sexps</a>.

   <p><a name="index-completion-in-edit-buffer-163"></a>Completion is provided in the edit buffer in a similar fashion to the
process buffer: <kbd>M-TAB</kbd> completes file names and <kbd>M-?</kbd> lists
file completions.  Since &lt;TAB&gt; is used for indentation in the edit
buffer, object completion is now performed with <kbd>C-c TAB</kbd>.  Note
however that completion is only provided over globally known S objects
(such as system functions) &mdash; it will <em>not</em> work for arguments to
functions or other variables local to the function you are editing.

   <p>Finally, two commands are provided for returning to the ESS process buffer:

     <ul>
<li><kbd>C-c C-z</kbd> (<code>ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dswitch_002dto_002dend_002dof_002dESS-164"></a>Returns you to the ESS process buffer, placing point at the end of the
buffer.

     <li><kbd>C-c C-y</kbd> (<code>ess-switch-to-ESS</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dswitch_002dto_002dESS-165"></a>Also returns to to the ESS process buffer, but leaves point where it was. 
</ul>

   <p>In addition some commands available in the process buffer are also
available in the edit buffer.  You can still read help files with
<kbd>C-c C-v</kbd>, edit another function with <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> and of course
<kbd>C-c C-l</kbd> can be used to load a source file into S.  See <a href="#Other">Other</a>,
for more details on these commands.

<h3 class="section">7.7 Maintaining S source files</h3>

<p>Every edit buffer in ESS is associated with a <dfn>dump file</dfn> on disk. 
Dump files are created whenever you type <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd>
(<code>ess-dump-object-into-edit-buffer</code>), and may either be deleted
after use, or kept as a backup file or as a means of keeping several
versions of an S function. 
<a name="index-dump-files-166"></a>

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>ess-delete-dump-files</b><var><a name="index-ess_002ddelete_002ddump_002dfiles-167"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>If non-<code>nil</code>, dump files created with C-c C-d are deleted
immediately after they are created by the ess-process. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>Since immediately after S dumps an object's definition to a disk
file the source code on disk corresponds exactly to S's idea of the
object's definition, the disk file isn't needed; deleting it now has the
advantage that if you <em>don't</em> modify the file (say, because you
just wanted to look at the definition of one of the standard S
functions) the source dump file won't be left around when you kill the
buffer.  Note that this variable only applies to files generated with
S's <code>dump</code> function; it doesn't apply to source files which already
exist.  The default value is <code>t</code>.

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>ess-keep-dump-files</b><var><a name="index-ess_002dkeep_002ddump_002dfiles-168"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Option controlling what to do with the dump file after an object has
been successfully loaded into S.  Valid values are <code>nil</code> (always
delete), <code>ask</code> (always ask whether to delete), <code>check</code> (delete
files generated with <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> in this Emacs session, otherwise ask
&mdash; this is the default) and <code>t</code> (never delete).  This variable is
buffer-local. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>After an object has been successfully (i.e. without error) loaded
back into S with <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>, the disk file again corresponds
exactly (well, almost &mdash; see below) to S's record of the object's
definition, and so some people prefer to delete the disk file rather
than unnecessarily use up space.  This option allows you to do just
that.

   <p><a name="index-comments-169"></a><a name="index-project-work-in-S-170"></a><a name="index-historic-backups-171"></a>If the value of <code>ess-keep-dump-files</code> is <code>t</code>, dump files are
never deleted after they are loaded.  Thus you can maintain a complete
text record of the functions you have edited within ESS.  Backup files
are kept as usual, and so by using the Emacs numbered backup facility &mdash;
see <a href="emacs.html#Backup-Names">Single or Numbered Backups</a>, you can keep a historic
record of function definitions.  Another possibility is to maintain the
files with a version-control system such as RCS See <a href="emacs.html#Version-Control">Version Control</a>.  As long as a dump file exists in the appropriate place for a
particular object, editing that object with <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> finds that
file for editing (unless a prefix argument is given) &mdash; the ESS
process is not consulted.  Thus you can keep comments <em>outside</em> the
function definition as a means of documentation that does not clutter
the S object itself.  Another useful feature is that you may format
the code in any fashion you please without S re-indenting the code
every time you edit it.  These features are particularly useful for
project-based work.

   <p>If the value of <code>ess-keep-dump-files</code> is nil, the dump file is always
silently deleted after a successful load with <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>.  While this
is useful for files that were created with <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> it also applies
to any other file you load (say, a source file of function
definitions), and so can be dangerous to use unless you are careful. 
Note that since <code>ess-keep-dump-files</code> is buffer-local, you can make
sure particular files are not deleted by setting it to <code>t</code> in the
Local Variables section of the file See <a href="emacs.html#File-Variables">Local Variables in Files</a>.

   <p>A safer option is to set <code>ess-keep-dump-files</code> to <code>ask</code>; this
means that ESS will always ask for confirmation before deleting the
file.  Since this can get annoying if you always want to delete dump
files created with <code>C-c C-d</code>, but not any other files, setting
<code>ess-keep-dump-files</code> to <code>check</code> (the default value) will
silently delete dump files created with <kbd>C-c C-d</kbd> in the current
Emacs session, but query for any other file.  Note that in any case you
will only be asked for confirmation once per file, and your answer is
remembered for the rest of the Emacs session.

   <p>Note that in all cases, if an error (such as a syntax error) is detected
while loading the file with <kbd>C-c C-l</kbd>, the dump file is <em>never</em>
deleted.  This is so that you can edit the file in a new Emacs session
if you happen to quit Emacs before correcting the error.

   <p><a name="index-autosaving-172"></a>Dump buffers are always autosaved, regardless of the value of
<code>ess-keep-dump-files</code>.

<h3 class="section">7.8 Names and locations of dump files</h3>

<p><a name="index-dump-file-names-173"></a>Every dump file should be given a unique file name, usually the dumped
object name with some additions.

<div class="defun">

object <code>myfun</code> the dump file will have name <samp><span class="file">joe.myfun.S</span></samp>. 
The username part is included to avoid clashes when dumping into a

this part if you are dumping into a directory owned by you.

   <p><a name="index-dump-file-directories-175"></a>You may also specify the directory in which dump files are written:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; User Option: <b>ess-source-directory</b><var><a name="index-ess_002dsource_002ddirectory-176"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Directory name (ending in a slash) where S dump files are to be written. 
</p></blockquote></div>

   <p>By default, dump files are always written to <samp><span class="file">/tmp</span></samp>, which is fine
when <code>ess-keep-dump-files</code> is <code>nil</code>.  If you are keeping dump
files, then you will probably want to keep them somewhere in your home
directory, say <samp><span class="file">~/S-source</span></samp>.  This could be achieved by including
the following line in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file:
<a name="index-g_t_0040file_007b_002eemacs_007d-file-177"></a>
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-source-directory (expand-file-name "~/S-source/"))
</pre>
   <p>If you would prefer to keep your dump files in separate directories
depending on the value of some variable, ESS provides a facility for
this also.  By setting <code>ess-source-directory</code> to a lambda
expression which evaluates to a directory name, you have a great deal of
flexibility in selecting the directory for a particular source file to
appear in.  The lambda expression is evaluated with the process buffer
as the current buffer and so you can use the variables local to that
buffer to make your choice.  For example, the following expression
causes source files to be saved in the subdirectory <samp><span class="file">Src</span></samp> of the
directory the ESS process was run in.

<pre class="example">     (setq ess-source-directory
           (lambda ()
              (concat ess-directory "Src/")))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent"><a name="index-ess_002ddirectory-178"></a>(<code>ess-directory</code> is a buffer-local variable in process buffers
which records the directory the ESS process was run from.)  This is
useful if you keep your dump files and you often edit objects with the
same name in different ESS processes.  Alternatively, if you often
change your S working directory during an S session, you may
like to keep dump files in some subdirectory of the directory pointed to
by the first element of the current search list.  This way you can edit
objects of the same name in different directories during the one S
session:
<a name="index-search-list-179"></a><a name="index-working-directory-180"></a>
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-source-directory
        (lambda ()
            (file-name-as-directory
             (expand-file-name (concat
                                (car ess-search-list)
                                "/.Src")))))
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-ess_002dsearch_002dlist-181"></a>
If the directory generated by the lambda function does not exist but can
be created, you will be asked whether you wish to create the directory. 
If you choose not to, or the directory cannot be created, you will not
be able to edit functions.

<h2 class="chapter">8 Editing R documentation files</h2>

<p>ESS also provides support for editing <dfn>R documentation</dfn> (&ldquo;Rd&rdquo;)
files.  R objects are documented in files written in Rd format, a
simple markup language closely resembling (La)TeX, which can be
processed into a variety of formats, including LaTeX, <acronym>HTML</acronym>,
and plain text.  Rd format is described in section &ldquo;Rd format&rdquo; of the
&ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo; manual in the R distribution.

   <p>Visiting an Rd file as characterized by its extension <samp><span class="file">Rd</span></samp> will
activate Rd Mode, which provides several facilities for making editing R
documentation files more convenient, by helping with indentation,
insertions, even doing some of the typing for you (with Abbrev Mode),
and by showing Rd keywords, strings, etc. in different faces (with
Font Lock Mode).

   <p>Note that R also accepts Rd files with extension <samp><span class="file">rd</span></samp>; to activate
<acronym>ESS[Rd]</acronym> support for this extension, you may need to add

<pre class="example">     (add-to-list 'auto-mode-alist '("\\.rd\\'" . Rd-mode))
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to one of your Emacs startup files.

   <p>In Rd mode, the following special Emacs commands can be used in addition
to the standard Emacs commands.

     <dl>
<dt><kbd>C-h m</kbd><dd>Describe the features of Rd mode.

     <br><dt><kbd>LFD</kbd><dt><kbd>RET</kbd><dd>Reindent the current line, insert a newline and indent the new line
(<code>reindent-then-newline-and-indent</code>).  An abbrev before point is
expanded if <code>abbrev-mode</code> is non-<code>nil</code>.

     <br><dt><kbd>TAB</kbd><dd>Indent current line based on its contents and on previous lines
(<code>indent-according-to-mode</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-e</kbd><dd>Insert a &ldquo;skeleton&rdquo; with Rd markup for at least all mandatory entries
in Rd files (<code>Rd-mode-insert-skeleton</code>).  Note that many users
might prefer to use the R function <code>prompt</code> on an existing R object
to generate a non-empty Rd &ldquo;shell&rdquo; documenting the object (which
already has all information filled in which can be obtained from the
object).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-f</kbd><dd>Insert &ldquo;font&rdquo; specifiers for some of the Rd markup commands markup
available for emphasizing or quoting text, including markup for URLs and
email addresses (<code>Rd-font</code>).  <kbd>C-c C-f</kbd> is only a prefix; see
e.g. <kbd>C-c C-f TAB</kbd> for the available bindings.  Note that
currently, not all of the Rd text markup as described in section
&ldquo;Marking text&rdquo; of &ldquo;Writing R Extensions&rdquo; can be accessed via
<kbd>C-c C-f</kbd>.

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-j</kbd><dd>Insert a suitably indented  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">\item{</span></samp>&rsquo; on the next line
(<code>Rd-mode-insert-item</code>).

     <br><dt><kbd>C-c C-p</kbd><dd>Preview a plain text version (&ldquo;help file&rdquo;, see <a href="#Help">Help</a>) generated
from the Rd file (<code>Rd-preview-help</code>). 
</dl>

   <p>In addition, when editing Rd files one can interact with a running R
process in a similar way as when editing R language files.  E.g.,
<kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> provides access to on-line help, and <kbd>C-c C-n</kbd> sends
the current line to the R process for evaluation.  This interaction is
particularly useful when editing the examples in the Rd file.  See
<kbd>C-h m</kbd> for all available commands.

   <p>Rd mode also provides access to abbreviations for most of the Rd markup
commands.  Type <kbd>M-x list-abbrevs</kbd> with Abbrev mode turned on to
list all available abbrevs.  Note that all Rd abbrevs start with a grave
accent.

   <p>Rd mode can be customized via the following variables.

     <dl>
<dt><code>Rd-mode-hook</code><dd>Hook to be run when Rd mode is entered. 
<br><dt><code>Rd-indent-level</code><dd>The indentation of Rd code with respect to containing blocks.  Default
is 2. 
<br><dt><code>Rd-to-help-command</code><dd>The shell command used for converting Rd source to help text.  Default
is &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">R CMD Rd2txt</span></samp>&rsquo;. 
</dl>

   <p>To automatically turn on the abbrev and font-lock features of Rd mode,
add the following lines to one of your Emacs startup files:

<pre class="example">     (add-hook 'Rd-mode-hook
               (lambda ()
                (abbrev-mode 1)
                (font-lock-mode 1)))

<h2 class="chapter">9 Reading help files</h2>

<p><a name="index-help-files-182"></a>
ESS provides an easy-to-use facility for reading S help files from
within Emacs.  From within the ESS process buffer or any ESS edit
buffer, typing <kbd>C-c C-v</kbd> (<code>ess-display-help-on-object</code>)
<a name="index-ess_002ddisplay_002dhelp_002don_002dobject-183"></a>will prompt you for the name of an object for which you would like
documentation.  Completion is provided over all objects which have help
files.

   <p>If the requested object has documentation, you will be popped into a
buffer (named <code>*help(</code><var>obj-name</var><code>)*</code>) containing the help file. 
This buffer is placed in a special `S Help' mode which disables the
usual editing commands but which provides a number of keys for paging
through the help file:

     <ul>
Help commands:

     <li><kbd>?</kbd> (<code>ess-describe-help-mode</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002ddescribe_002dhelp_002dmode-184"></a>Pops up a help buffer with a list of the commands available in S help
mode.

     <li><kbd>h</kbd> (<code>ess-display-help-on-object</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002ddisplay_002dhelp_002don_002dobject-185"></a>Pop up a help buffer for a different object

     <p>Paging commands:

     <p><a name="index-paging-commands-in-help-buffers-186"></a><li><kbd>b</kbd> or <kbd>DEL</kbd> (<code>scroll-down</code>) <br>
Move one page backwards through the help file.

     <li><kbd>SPC</kbd> (<code>scroll-up</code>) <br>
Move one page forwards through the help file.

     <li><kbd>&gt;</kbd> (<code>beginning-of-buffer</code>) and <kbd>&lt;</kbd> (<code>end-of-buffer</code>)
<br>
Move to the beginning and end of the help file, respectively.

     <p>Section-based motion commands:

     <li><kbd>n</kbd> (<code>ess-skip-to-next-section</code>) and <kbd>p</kbd>
(<code>ess-skip-to-previous-section</code>) <br> Move to the next and previous
<a name="index-ess_002dskip_002dto_002dnext_002dsection-187"></a><a name="index-ess_002dskip_002dto_002dprevious_002dsection-188"></a>section header in the help file, respectively.  A section header
consists of a number of capitalized words, followed by a colon.

     <p>In addition, the <kbd>s</kbd> key followed by one of the following letters
will jump to a particular section in the help file. 
Note that R uses capitalized instead of all-capital section headers,
e.g., &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Description:</span></samp>&rsquo; instead of  &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">DESCRIPTION:</span></samp>&rsquo; and also
only some versions of S(-plus) have
sections &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BACKGROUND</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">BUGS</span></samp>&rsquo;, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">OPTIONAL ARGUMENTS</span></samp>&rsquo;,
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">REQUIRED ARGUMENTS</span></samp>&rsquo;, and &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SIDE EFFECTS</span></samp>&rsquo;.

</dl>

     <p>Miscellaneous:

     <li><kbd>l</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-line-and-step</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dline_002dand_002dstep-190"></a>Evaluates the current line in the ESS process, and moves to the next
line.  Useful for running examples in help files.

     <li><kbd>r</kbd> (<code>ess-eval-region</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002deval_002dregion-191"></a>Send the contents of the current region to the ESS process.  Useful
for running examples in help files.

     <li><kbd>/</kbd> (<code>isearch-forward</code>) <br>
Same as <kbd>C-s</kbd>.

     <p>Quit commands:

     <li><kbd>q</kbd> (<code>ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS</code>) <br>
<a name="index-ess_002dswitch_002dto_002dend_002dof_002dESS-192"></a>Returns to the ESS process buffer in another window, leaving the
help window visible.

     <li><kbd>k</kbd> (<code>kill-buffer</code>) <br>
Kills the help buffer.

     <li><kbd>x</kbd> (<code>ess-kill-buffer-and-go</code>) <br>
Return to the ESS process, killing this help buffer. 
</ul>

   <p>In addition, all of the ESS commands available in the edit buffers are
also available in S help mode (see <a href="#Edit-buffer">Edit buffer</a>).  Of course, the
usual (non-editing) Emacs commands are available, and for convenience
the digits and &lt;-&gt; act as prefix arguments.

   <p>If a help buffer already exists for an object for which help is
requested, that buffer is popped to immediately; the ESS process is
not consulted at all.  If the contents of the help file have changed,
you either need to kill the help buffer first, or pass a prefix argument
(with <kbd>C-u</kbd>) to <code>ess-display-help-on-object</code>.

   <p>Help buffers are marked as temporary buffers in ESS, and are deleted
when <code>ess-quit</code> or <code>ess-cleanup</code> are called.

   <p>Help buffers normally appear in another window within the current
frame.  If you wish help buffers to appear in their own frame (either
one per help buffer, or one for all help buffers), you can customize the
variable <code>ess-help-own-frame</code>.

   <p><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> was written with two primary goals.
     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>The emacs text editor provides a powerful and flexible development

<li>Although a departure from <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager, <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> provides
similar key definitions to give novice <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> users a head start. 
Also, inconvenient <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager features, like remote submission

<h3 class="section">10.2 ESS(SAS)&ndash;Editing files</h3>

<p><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> is the mode for editing <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> language files.  This mode handles:

     <ul>
<li>proper indenting, generated by both &lt;TAB&gt; and &lt;RET&gt;. 
<li>color and font choices based on syntax. 
<li>ability to save and submit the file you are working on as a batch
<acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> process with a single keypress and to continue editing while it is runs
in the background. 
<li>capability of killing the batch <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> process through the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer or
allow the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> process to keep on running after you exit emacs. 
<li>single keypress navigation of <samp><span class="file">.sas</span></samp>, <samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.lst</span></samp> files
(<samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> and <samp><span class="file">.lst</span></samp> files are refreshed with each keypress). 
<li>ability to send the contents of an entire buffer, a highlighted region,
or a single line to an interactive <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> process. 
<li>ability to switch between processes which would be the target of the
buffer (for the above). 
</ul>

   <p><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> is automatically turned on when editing a file with a <samp><span class="file">.sas</span></samp>
suffix (or other extension, if specified via <code>auto-mode-alist</code>).  The function
keys can be enabled to use the same function keys that
the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager does.  The interactive capabilities of <acronym>ESS</acronym> require you
to start an inferior <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> process with <kbd>M-x&nbsp;SAS</kbd><!-- /@w -->
(See <a href="#iESS_0028SAS_0029_002d_002dInteractive-SAS-processes">iESS(SAS)&ndash;Interactive SAS processes</a>.)

   <p>At this writing, the indenting and syntax highlighting are generally
correct.  Known issues: for multiple line <code>*</code> or <code>%*</code> comments, only the
first line is highlighted; for <samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> files, only the first line of a
<code>NOTE:</code>, <code>WARNING:</code> or <code>ERROR:</code> message is highlighted; unmatched
single/double quotes in <code>CARDS</code> data lines are <strong>NOT</strong> ignored; in an
iterative <code>DO</code> statement, <code>TO</code> and <code>BY</code> are not highlighted.

<p>Two options.  The &lt;TAB&gt; key is bound by default to <code>sas-indent-line</code>.  This
function is used to syntactically indent <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> code so <code>PROC</code> and <code>RUN</code> are in
the left margin, other statements are indented <code>sas-indent-width</code> spaces from the margin,
continuation lines are indented <code>sas-indent-width</code> spaces in from the beginning column of
that statement.  This is the type of functionality that emacs provides
in most programming language modes.  This functionality is equivalent to
uncommenting the following line in <samp><span class="file">ess-site.el</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle nil)
</pre>
   <p><acronym>ESS</acronym> provides an alternate behavior for &lt;TAB&gt; that makes it behave
as it does in <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager, i.e. move the cursor to the next stop. 
The alternate behavior also provides a "TAB" backwards, <kbd>C-&lt;TAB&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w -->, that
moves the cursor to the stop to the left and deletes any characters
between them.  This functionality is obtained by uncommenting the
following line in <samp><span class="file">ess-site.el</span></samp>:
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-sas-edit-keys-toggle t)
</pre>
   <p>Under the alternate behavior, &lt;TAB&gt; is bound to <kbd>M-x&nbsp;tab-to-tab-stop</kbd><!-- /@w -->
and the stops are defined by <code>ess-sas-tab-stop-list</code>.

<h3 class="section">10.4 ESS(SAS)&ndash;Batch SAS processes</h3>

<p>Submission of a <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch job is dependent on your environment. 
<code>ess-sas-submit-method</code> is determined by your operating system and
your shell.  It defaults to <code>'sh</code> unless you are running Windows or
Mac Classic.  Under Windows, it will default to <code>'sh</code> if you are using
a <acronym>UNIX</acronym>-imitating shell; otherwise <code>'ms-dos</code> for an <acronym>MS-DOS</acronym>
shell.  On Mac OS X, it will default to <code>'sh</code>, but under Mac Classic,
it defaults to <code>'apple-script</code>.  You will also set this to <code>'sh</code>
if the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch job needs to run on a remote machine rather than your
local machine.  This works transparently if you are editing the remote file
via ange-ftp/EFS or tramp.  Note that
<code>ess-sas-shell-buffer-remote-init</code> is a Local Variable that defaults
to <code>"ssh"</code> which will be used to open the buffer on the remote host
and it is assumed that no password is necessary, i.e. you are using
<code>ssh-agent</code>/<code>ssh-add</code> or the equivalent (see the discussion about
Local Variables below if you need to change the default).

   <p>However, if you are editing the file locally and transferring it back and
forth with Kermit, you need some additional steps.  First, start Kermit
locally before remotely logging in.  Open a local copy of the file with the
<code>ess-kermit-prefix</code> character prepended (the default is <code>"#"</code>). 
Execute the command <kbd>M-x&nbsp;ess-kermit-get</kbd><!-- /@w --> which automatically brings
the contents of the remote file into your local copy.  If you transfer
files with Kermit manually in a <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer, then note that the
Kermit escape sequence is <kbd>C-q&nbsp;C-&nbsp;c</kbd><!-- /@w --> rather than <kbd>C-&nbsp;c</kbd><!-- /@w --> which
it would be in an ordinary terminal application, i.e. not in an emacs
buffer.  Lastly, note that the remote Kermit command is specified by
<code>ess-kermit-command</code>.

   <p>The command used by the <code>SUBMIT</code> function key (&lt;F3&gt; or &lt;F8&gt;)
to submit a batch <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> job, whether local or remote, is
<code>ess-sas-submit-command</code> which defaults to <code>sas-program</code>. 
<code>sas-program</code> is <code>"invoke SAS using program file"</code> for Mac
Classic and <code>"sas"</code> otherwise.  However, you may have to alter
<code>ess-sas-submit-command</code> for a particular program, so it is defined as
buffer-local.  Conveniently, it can be set at the end of the program:
<pre class="example">     endsas;
     Local variables:
     ess-sas-submit-command: "sas8"
     End:
</pre>
   <p>The command line is also made of <code>ess-sas-submit-pre-command</code>,
<code>ess-sas-submit-post-command</code> and <code>ess-sas-submit-command-options</code>
(the last of which is also buffer-local). 
Here are some examples for your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">~/.xemacs/init.el</span></samp>
file (you may also use <kbd>M-x&nbsp;customize-variable</kbd><!-- /@w -->):
<pre class="example">     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "nohup")
     ;'sh default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser &amp;")
     ;'sh example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "/usr/local/sas/sas")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-pre-command "start")
     ;'ms-dos default
     (setq ess-sas-submit-post-command "-rsasuser -icon")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:/progra~1/sas/sas.exe")
     ;Windows example
     (setq-default ess-sas-submit-command "c:\\progra~1\\sas\\sas.exe")
</pre>
   <p>There is a built-in delay before a batch <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> job is submitted when using
a <acronym>UNIX</acronym>-imitating shell under Windows.  This is necessary in many cases
since the shell might not be ready to receive a command.  This delay is
currently set high enough so as not to be a problem.  But, there may be
cases when it needs to be set higher, or could be set much lower to
speed things up.  You can over-ride the default in your <samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">~/.xemacs/init.el</span></samp> file by:
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-sleep-for 0.2)
</pre>
   <p>For example, <code>(setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)</code> keys shown,
<code>(setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)</code> in parentheses;
<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> function keys are presented in the next section. 
Open the file you want to work with <kbd>C-x&nbsp;C-f&nbsp;foo.sas</kbd><!-- /@w -->. 
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp> will be in <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> mode.  Edit as appropriate, then save and
submit the batch <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> job.
<pre class="example">     &lt;F3&gt; (&lt;F8&gt;)
</pre>
   <p>The job runs in the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer while you continue to edit
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp>.  If <code>ess-sas-submit-method</code> is <code>'sh</code>, then the
message buffer will display the shell notification when the
job is complete.  The <code>'sh</code> setting also allows you to
terminate the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch job before it is finished.
<pre class="example">     &lt;F8&gt; (&lt;F3&gt;)

<pre class="example">     kill <var>PID</var>

   <p>You may want to visit the <samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> (whether the job is still running
or it is finished) and check for error messages.  The <samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> will be

<h3 class="section">10.5 ESS(SAS)&ndash;Function keys for batch processing</h3>

<p>The setup of function keys for <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch processing
is unavoidably complex, but the usage of function keys is simple. 
There are five distinct options:

   <p>Option 1 (default).  Function keys in <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> are not bound to elisp
commands.  This is in accordance with the GNU Elisp Coding Standards
(<acronym>GECS</acronym>) which do not allow function keys to be bound so that they are
available to the user.

   <p>Options 2-5.  Since <acronym>GECS</acronym> does not allow function keys to be bound by
modes, these keys are often unused.  So, <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> provides users with
the option of binding elisp commands to these keys.  Users who are
familiar with <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> will, most likely, want to duplicate the function key
capabilities of the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager.  There are four options (noted
in parentheses).

     <ol type=a start=1>
<li><acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager has different function key definitions for
<acronym>UNIX</acronym> (2, 4) and Windows (3, 5); <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> can use either. 
<li>The <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> function key definitions can be active in all buffers
(global: 4, 5) or limited (local: 2, 3) only to buffers with files that
are associated with <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> as specified in your <code>auto-mode-alist</code>.
        </ol>

   <p>The distinction between local and global is subtle.  If you want the
<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> definitions to work when you are in the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer or when
editing files other than the file extensions that <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> recognizes,
you will most likely want to use the global definitions.  If you want
your function keys to understand <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch commands when you are editing
<acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> files, and to behave normally when editing other files, then you
will choose the local definitions.  The option can be chosen by the
person installing <acronym>ESS</acronym> for a site or by an individual.

     <ol type=a start=1>
<li>For a site installation or an individual, uncomment <strong>ONLY ONE</strong> of the
following lines in your <samp><span class="file">ess-site.el</span></samp>.  <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> function keys are
available in <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> if you uncomment either 2 or 3 and in all modes if
you uncomment 4 or 5:
     <pre class="example">          ;;2; (setq ess-sas-local-unix-keys t)
          ;;3; (setq ess-sas-local-pc-keys t)
          ;;4; (setq ess-sas-global-unix-keys t)
          ;;5; (setq ess-sas-global-pc-keys t)
</pre>
     <p>The names <code>-unix-</code> and <code>-pc-</code> have nothing to do with the operating system
that you are running.  Rather, they mimic the definitions that the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w -->
Display Manager uses by default on those platforms.

     <li>If your site installation has configured the keys contrary to your
liking, then you must call the appropriate function.
     <pre class="example">           (load "ess-site") ;; local-unix-keys
           (ess-sas-global-pc-keys)
</pre>
     </ol>

   <p>Finally, we get to what the function keys actually do.  You may recognize
some of the nicknames as <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager commands (they are in all
capitals).

   <p><code>SUBMIT</code>, <code>PROGRAM</code>, <code>LOG</code> and <code>OUTPUT</code> need no further
explanation since they mimic the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager commands and
related function key definitions.  However, six other keys have been
provided for convenience and are described below.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">shell</span></samp>&rsquo; switches you to the <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp> buffer where you can
interact with your operating system.  This is especially helpful if you
would like to kill a <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch job.  You can specify a different buffer
name to associate with a <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch job (besides <samp><span class="file">*shell*</span></samp>) with the
buffer-local variable <code>ess-sas-shell-buffer</code>.  This allows you to have
multiple buffers running <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch jobs on multiple local/remote
computers that may rely on different methods specified by the buffer-local
variable <code>ess-sas-submit-method</code>.

   <p>&lt;F2&gt; performs the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">refresh</span></samp>&rsquo; operation on the current buffer. 
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">refresh</span></samp>&rsquo; compares the buffer's last modified date/time with the
file's last modified date/time and replaces the buffer with the file if the
file is newer.  This is the same operation that is automatically performed
when <code>LOG</code>, <code>OUTPUT</code>, &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">filetype-1</span></samp>&rsquo; or &lt;F11&gt; are pressed.

   <p>&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">filetype-1</span></samp>&rsquo; switches you to a file with the same file name as your <samp><span class="file">.sas</span></samp>
file, but with a different extension (<samp><span class="file">.txt</span></samp> by default) and performs
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">refresh</span></samp>&rsquo;.  You can over-ride the default extension; for example in your
<samp><span class="file">~/.emacs</span></samp> or <samp><span class="file">~/.xemacs/init.el</span></samp> file:
<pre class="example">     (setq ess-sas-suffix-1 "csv") ; for example
</pre>
   <p>&lt;F9&gt; will prompt you for the name of a permanent <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> dataset near
point to be opened for viewing by <code>PROC FSEDIT</code>.  You can control the
<acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch command-line with <code>ess-sas-data-view-submit-options</code>. 
For controlling the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch commands, you have the global variables
<code>ess-sas-data-view-libname</code> and
<code>ess-sas-data-view-fsview-command</code> as well as the buffer-local
variable <code>ess-sas-data-view-fsview-statement</code>.  If you have your
<acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> <code>LIBNAME</code> defined in <samp><span class="file">~/autoexec.sas</span></samp>, then the defaults
for these variables should be sufficient.

   <p>Similarly, <kbd>C-&lt;F9&gt;</kbd><!-- /@w --> will prompt you for the name of a permanent

You can control the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch command-line with

<h3 class="section">10.6 iESS(SAS)&ndash;Interactive SAS processes</h3>

<p>Inferior <acronym>ESS</acronym> (i<acronym>ESS</acronym><!-- /@w -->) is the method for interfacing with interactive
statistical processes (programs).  i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w --> is what is needed for
interactive <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> programming.  i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w --> works best
with the <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> command-line option settings
<code>"-stdio -linesize 80 -noovp -nosyntaxcheck"</code>
(the default of <code>inferior-SAS-args</code>).

<pre class="display">     <code>-stdio</code>
                 required to make the redirection of stdio work
     <code>-linesize 80</code>
                 keeps output lines from folding on standard terminals
     <code>-noovp</code>
                 prevents error messages from printing 3 times
     <code>-nosyntaxcheck</code>
                 permits recovery after syntax errors
</pre>
   <p>To start up i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w --> mode, use:
<pre class="example">        <kbd>M-x&nbsp;SAS</kbd><!-- /@w -->
</pre>
   <p>The <samp><span class="file">*SAS:1.log*</span></samp> buffer in <code>ESStr</code> mode corresponds to the file
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.log</span></samp> in <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch usage and to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SAS: LOG</span></samp>&rsquo; window in the
<acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager.  All commands submitted to <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w -->, informative
messages, warnings, and errors appear here.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">*SAS:1.lst*</span></samp> buffer in <code>ESSlst</code> mode corresponds to the file
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.lst</span></samp> in <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> batch usage and to the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SAS: OUTPUT</span></samp>&rsquo; window in the
<acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> Display Manager.  All printed output appears in this window.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">*SAS:1*</span></samp> buffer exists solely as a communications buffer. 
The user should never use this buffer directly. 
Files are edited in the <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp> buffer.  The <kbd>C-c&nbsp;C-r</kbd><!-- /@w --> key in
<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> is the functional equivalent of bringing a file into the
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">SAS: PROGRAM EDITOR</span></samp>&rsquo; window followed by <code>SUBMIT</code>.

   <p>For example, open the file you want to work with.
<pre class="example">     <kbd>C-x&nbsp;C-f&nbsp;foo.sas</kbd><!-- /@w -->
</pre>
   <p><samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp> will be in <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym> mode.  Edit as appropriate, and then start
up <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> with the cursor in the <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp> buffer.
<pre class="example">     <kbd>M-x&nbsp;SAS</kbd><!-- /@w -->
</pre>
   <p>Four buffers will appear on screen:
   <p><table summary=""><tr align="left"><td valign="top">Buffer               </td><td valign="top">Mode                   </td><td valign="top">Description
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top"><samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp> </td><td valign="top"><code><acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym></code>        </td><td valign="top">your source file
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top"><samp><span class="file">*SAS:1*</span></samp>       </td><td valign="top"><code>i<acronym>ESS[SAS:1]</acronym><!-- /@w --></code>     </td><td valign="top">i<acronym>ESS</acronym><!-- /@w --> communication buffer
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top"><samp><span class="file">*SAS:1.log*</span></samp>   </td><td valign="top"><code>Shell ESStr []</code>  </td><td valign="top"><acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> log information
<br></td></tr><tr align="left"><td valign="top"><samp><span class="file">*SAS:1.lst*</span></samp>   </td><td valign="top"><code>Shell ESSlst []</code> </td><td valign="top"><acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> listing information
   <br></td></tr></table>
If you would prefer each of the four buffers to appear in its
own individual frame, you can arrange for that.  Place the
cursor in the buffer displaying <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp>.  Enter the
sequence <kbd>C-c&nbsp;C-w</kbd><!-- /@w -->. The cursor will normally be in buffer
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp>.  If not, put it there and <kbd>C-x&nbsp;b&nbsp;</kbd><var>foo</var><kbd>.sas</kbd><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>Send regions, lines, or the entire file contents to <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w -->
(regions are most useful:  a highlighted region will normally
begin with the keywords <code>DATA</code> or <code>PROC</code> and end with
<code>RUN;</code>), <kbd>C-c&nbsp;C-r</kbd><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>Information appears in the log buffer, analysis results in the
listing buffer.  In case of errors, make the corrections in the
<samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp> buffer and resubmit with another <kbd>C-c&nbsp;C-r</kbd><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>At the end of the session you may save the log and listing
buffers with the usual <kbd>C-x&nbsp;C-s</kbd><!-- /@w --> commands.  You will be prompted
for a file name.  Typically, the names <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.log</span></samp> and <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.lst</span></samp>
will be used.  You will almost certainly want to edit the saved
files before including them in a report.  The files are
read-only by default.  You can make them writable by the emacs
command <kbd>C-x&nbsp;C-q</kbd><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>At the end of the session, the input file <samp><var>foo</var><span class="file">.sas</span></samp> will
typically have been revised.  You can save it.  It can be used
later as the beginning of another i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w --> session.  It can
also be used as a batch input file to <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w -->.

   <p>The <samp><span class="file">*SAS:1*</span></samp> buffer is strictly for <acronym>ESS</acronym> use.  The user should
never need to read it or write to it.  Refer to the <samp><span class="file">.lst</span></samp> and
<samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> buffers for monitoring output!

     <ol type=1 start=1>
<li>i<acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym><!-- /@w --> does not work on Windows.  In order to run <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> inside
an emacs buffer, it is necessary to start <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> with the <code>-stdio</code> option. 
<acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w --> does not support the <code>-stdio</code> option on Windows. 
<li>If <kbd>M-x&nbsp;SAS</kbd><!-- /@w --> gives errors upon startup, check the following:
          <ul>
<li>you are running Windows:  see 1. 
<li><samp><span class="file">ess-sas-sh-command</span></samp> (from the <acronym>ESS</acronym> <samp><span class="file">etc</span></samp> directory) needs to be

type <kbd>M-:</kbd>, then at the minibuffer prompt &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Eval:</span></samp>&rsquo;<!-- /@w -->,
type <code>(set-file-modes "ess-sas-sh-command" 493)</code>. 
<!-- (solution: @code{chmod ugo+rx ess-sas-sh-command}). -->
<li><code>sas</code> isn't in your executable path; to verify, type
<kbd>M-:</kbd> and at the minibuffer prompt &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">Eval:</span></samp>&rsquo;, type
<code>(executable-find "sas")</code>
</ul>
     <li><kbd>M-x&nbsp;SAS</kbd><!-- /@w --> starts <acronym>SAS</acronym><!-- /@w -->&nbsp;Display<!-- /@w --> Manager.  Probably, the command <code>sas</code>
on your system calls a shell script.  In that case you will need to locate
the real  <code>sas</code> executable and link to it. 
You can execute the <acronym>UNIX</acronym> command:
     <pre class="example">          find / -name sas -print
</pre>
     <p>Now place a soft link to the real <code>sas</code> executable in your <code>~/bin</code>
directory, with for example
     <pre class="example">          cd ~/bin
          ln -s /usr/local/sas9/sas sas
</pre>
     </ol>
Check your <code>PATH</code> environment variable to confirm that
<code>~/bin</code> appears before the directory in which the <code>sas</code>
shell script appears.

<!-- Specify the path to the real -->
<!-- @code{sas} executable in @file{ess-sas-sh-command}, i.e.: -->
<!-- @example -->
<!-- /usr/local/sas9/sas $@@ </dev/tty 1>$stdout 2>$stderr -->

<p><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> was originally designed for use with BUGS software. 
Later, it evolved to support JAGS as a dialect of the
BUGS language via <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>, however, <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym> is documented in
the section Help for JAGS. 
<acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> provides 5 features.  First, BUGS syntax is described to
allow for proper fontification of statements, distributions,
functions, commands and comments in BUGS model files, command files
and log files.  Second, <acronym>ESS</acronym> creates templates for the command file
from the model file so that a BUGS batch process can be defined by a
single file.  Third, <acronym>ESS</acronym> provides a BUGS batch script that allows <acronym>ESS</acronym>
to set BUGS batch parameters.  Fourth, key sequences are defined to
create a command file and submit a BUGS batch process.  Lastly,
interactive submission of BUGS commands is also supported.

<h3 class="section">11.1 ESS[BUGS]&ndash;Model files</h3>

<p>Model files with the <samp><span class="file">.bug</span></samp> extension are edited in <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> mode
if <code>(require 'essd-bugs)</code> was performed or edited in <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym> mode
if <code>(require 'essd-jags)</code>. 
Three keys are bound for your use in <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>, <kbd>F2</kbd>, <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> and <kbd>=</kbd>. 
<kbd>F2</kbd> performs the same action as it does in <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>,
See <a href="#ESS_0028SAS_0029_002d_002dFunction-keys-for-batch-processing">ESS(SAS)&ndash;Function keys for batch processing</a>.  <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> performs the
function <code>ess-bugs-next-action</code> which you will use a lot.  Pressing it
in an empty buffer for a model file will produce a template for you.  <kbd>=</kbd>
inserts the set operator, <code>&lt;-</code>.

   <p><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> supports "replacement" variables.  These variables are
created as part of the template, i.e. with the first press of <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
in an empty buffer.  They are named by all capitals and start
with <code>%</code>: <code>%N</code>, <code>%DATA</code>, <code>%INIT</code>, <code>%MONITOR</code> and
<code>%STATS</code>.  When you are
finished editing your model file, pressing <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> will perform
the necessary replacements and build your command file for you.

   <p>The <code>%DATA</code> variable appears in the line <code>data in "%DATA";</code>.  On the
second press of <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, <code>%DATA</code> will be replaced by the model file name
except it will have the <samp><span class="file">.dat</span></samp> extension.  If your data file is named
something else, then change <code>%DATA</code> in the template to the appropriate
file name and no replacement will occur.

   <p>The <code>%INIT</code> variable appears in the line <code>inits in "%INIT";</code>. 
On the second press of <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, <code>%INIT</code> will be
replaced by the model file name except it will have the .in extension. 
If your model will be generating it's own initial values, place a
comment character, <code>#</code>, at the beginning of the line.  Or, if your init
file is named something else, then change <code>%INIT</code> in the template to the
appropriate file name.

   <p>The <code>%N</code> variable appears in the line <code>const N = 0;#%N</code>. 
Although it is commented, it is still active.  Notice that later on in
the template you have the line <code>for (i in 1:N)</code>.  The BUGS
constant <code>N</code> is the number of rows in your data file.  When you
press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, the data file is read and the number of lines are
counted (after <code>%DATA</code> is resolved, if necessary).  The number of
lines replace the zero in the <code>const N = 0;</code> statement.

   <p>The <code>%MONITOR</code> variable appears on a line by itself.  Although it
is commented, it is still active.  This line is a list of variables
that you want monitored.  When you press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, the
appropriate statements are created in the command file to monitor the
list of variables.  If the line is blank, then the list is populated
with the variables from the <code>var</code> statement.

   <p>The <code>%STATS</code> variable is similar to the <code>%MONITOR</code> variable. 
It is a list of variables for which summary statistics will be
calculated.  When you press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, the appropriate statements
will be generated in your command file.

   <p>Please note that the <code>%DATA</code> and <code>%INIT</code> variables are only
replaced on the second press of <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, but the actions for
<code>%N</code>, <code>%MONITOR</code> and <code>%STATS</code> are performed on each
press of <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> if you re-visit the model file.

<h3 class="section">11.2 ESS[BUGS]&ndash;Command files</h3>

<p>To avoid extension name collision, <samp><span class="file">.bmd</span></samp> is used for BUGS
command files and <samp><span class="file">.jmd</span></samp> for JAGS command files.  When you have
finished editing your model file and press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, a command
file is created if one does not already exist.  However, the command
file was created, it recognizes two "replacement" variables:
<code>%MONITOR</code> and <code>%STATS</code>.

   <p>Two <code>%MONITOR</code> variables appears on lines by themselves. 
Although they are commented, they are still active.  Between them
appears the necessary statements to monitor the list of variables
specified in the model file.  The behavior of the <code>%STATS</code>
variable is similar.

   <p>When you are finished editing your command file, pressing <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
again will submit your command file as a batch job.  BUGS batch
scripts are provided for both Unix and DOS in the <samp><span class="file">etc</span></samp>
sub-directory of the <acronym>ESS</acronym> distribution.  The Unix script is
<samp><span class="file">backbugs</span></samp> for BUGS major version 0.6 and <samp><span class="file">backbug5</span></samp> for
0.5. The DOS script is <samp><span class="file">BACKBUGS.BAT</span></samp> for BUGS major version 0.6

<p>To avoid extension name collision, <samp><span class="file">.bog</span></samp> is used for BUGS log
files.  The BUGS batch script provided with <acronym>ESS</acronym> creates the
<samp><span class="file">.bog</span></samp> file from the <samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> file when the batch process
completes.  If you need to look at the <samp><span class="file">.log</span></samp> file while the

<p><acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> was originally designed for use with BUGS software. 
Later, it evolved to support JAGS as a dialect of the
BUGS language via <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>.  Since BUGS and JAGS are quite
similar, <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> and <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym> are necessarily similar. 
<acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym> provides 4 features.  First, JAGS syntax is described to
allow for proper fontification of statements, distributions,
functions, commands and comments in JAGS model files, command files
and log files.  Second, <acronym>ESS</acronym> creates templates for the command file
from the model file so that a JAGS batch process can be defined by a
single file.  Third, <acronym>ESS</acronym> provides a JAGS batch script that allows <acronym>ESS</acronym>
to set JAGS batch parameters.  Fourth, key sequences are defined to
create a command file and submit a JAGS batch process.

<h3 class="section">12.1 ESS[JAGS]&ndash;Model files</h3>

<p>Model files with the <samp><span class="file">.bug</span></samp> extension are edited in <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym> mode
if <code>(require 'essd-bugs)</code> was performed or edited in <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym> mode
if <code>(require 'essd-jags)</code>. 
Three keys are bound for your use in <acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>, <kbd>F2</kbd>, <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> and <kbd>=</kbd>. 
<kbd>F2</kbd> performs the same action as it does in <acronym>ESS[SAS]</acronym>,
See <a href="#ESS_0028SAS_0029_002d_002dFunction-keys-for-batch-processing">ESS(SAS)&ndash;Function keys for batch processing</a>.  <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> performs the
function <code>ess-bugs-next-action</code> which you will use a lot.  Pressing it
in an empty buffer for a model file will produce a template for you.  <kbd>=</kbd>
inserts the set operator, <code>&lt;-</code>.

   <p><acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym> does not support "replacement" variables which were part of
<acronym>ESS[BUGS]</acronym>.  Although, "replacement" variables are an extremely convenient
feature, creating the elisp code for their operation was challenging.  So, a
more elisp-ish approach was adopted for <acronym>ESS[JAGS]</acronym>:  elisp local variables. 
These variables are
created as part of the template, i.e. with the first press of <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
in an empty buffer.  For your <samp><span class="file">.bug</span></samp> file, they are named
<code>ess-jags-chains</code>, <code>ess-jags-monitor</code>, <code>ess-jags-thin</code>,
<code>ess-jags-burnin</code> and <code>ess-jags-update</code>;
they appear in the <code>Local Variables</code> section.  When you are
finished editing your model file, pressing <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd> will perform
the necessary actions to build your command file for you.

   <p>The <code>ess-jags-chains</code> variable is the number of chains that
you want to initialize and sample from; defaults to 1. 
The <code>ess-jags-monitor</code> variable is a list of variables
that you want monitored: encase each variable in double quotes. 
When you press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, the
appropriate statements are created in the command file to monitor the
list of variables.  By default, no variables are explicitly monitored
which means JAGS will implicitly monitor all &ldquo;default&rdquo; variables. 
The <code>ess-jags-thin</code> variable is the thinning parameter. 
By default, the thinning parameter is set to 1, i.e. no thinning. 
The <code>ess-jags-burnin</code> variable is the number of initial samples
to discard.  By default, the burnin parameter is set to 10000. 
The <code>ess-jags-update</code> variable is the number of post-burnin samples
to keep.  By default, the update parameter is set to 10000.  Both
<code>ess-jags-burnin</code> and <code>ess-jags-update</code> are multiplied by
<code>ess-jags-thin</code> since JAGS does not do it automatically.

in the <code>Local Variables</code> section.  When you have
finished editing your model file and press <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>, a command
file is created if one does not already exist. 
When you are finished editing your command file, pressing <kbd>C-c C-c</kbd>
again will submit your command file as a batch job. 
The <code>ess-jags-command</code> variable allows you to specify a different
JAGS program to use to run your model; defaults to &ldquo;jags&rdquo;.

<h3 class="section">13.1 Syntactic highlighting of buffers</h3>

<p>ESS provides Font-Lock (see <a href="emacs.html#Faces">Using Multiple Typefaces</a>) patterns for Inferior S Mode, S
Mode, and S Transcript Mode buffers. 
<a name="index-Font_002dlock-mode-196"></a><a name="index-highlighting-197"></a>
Syntax highlighting within ESS buffers is controlled by the variable
<code>ess-font-lock-mode</code>, which by default is true. 
Input to inferior ESS processes is also highlighted syntactically if
<code>inferior-ess-font-lock-input</code> is non-nil (the default). 
If you change the value of either of these varibles, you need to restart
emacs for your changes to take effect.

<!-- To activate highlighting, you need to turn on Font Lock mode in the -->
<!-- appropriate buffers.  This can be done on a per-buffer basis with -->
<!-- @kbd{M-x font-lock-mode}, or may be done by adding -->
<!-- @code{turn-on-font-lock} to @code{inferior-ess-mode-hook}, -->
<!-- @code{ess-mode-hook} and @code{ess-transcript-mode-hook}.  Your systems -->
<!-- administrator may have done this for you in @file{ess-site.el} -->
<!-- (@pxref{Customization}). -->
   <p>The font-lock patterns are defined in the following variables, which you
may modify if desired:

<div class="defun">
&mdash; Variable: <b>inferior-ess-R-font-lock-keywords</b><var><a name="index-inferior_002dess_002dR_002dfont_002dlock_002dkeywords-198"></a></var><br>
<blockquote><p>Font-lock patterns for inferior *R* processes.  (There is a
corresponding <code>inferior-ess-S-font-lock-keywords</code> for *S*
processes.) The default value highlights prompts, inputs, assignments,
output messages, vector and matrix labels, and literals such as
&lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">NA</span></samp>&rsquo; and <code>TRUE</code>. 
</p></blockquote></div>

<div class="defun">

<blockquote><p>Font-lock patterns for ESS R programming mode.  (There is a

functions and reserved words.

<p>Emacs and XEmacs have facilities for highlighting the parenthesis

also indicates when parentheses are not matching.  Depending on what
version of emacs you use, one of the following should work in your
initialisation file:

<pre class="example">     (paren-set-mode 'paren) ;for XEmacs
     (show-paren-mode t) ;for Emacs

<h3 class="section">13.3 Using graphics with ESS</h3>

<p><a name="index-graphics-200"></a>One of the main features of the <code>S</code> package is its ability to
generate high-resolution graphics plots, and ESS provides a number of
features for dealing with such plots.

<ul class="menu">
<li><a accesskey="1" href="#printer">printer</a>:                      The printer() graphics driver
<li><a accesskey="2" href="#X11">X11</a>:                          The X11() (and other X-windows based) driver

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.1 Using ESS with the <code>printer()</code> driver</h4>

<p>This is the simplest (and least desirable) method of using graphics
within ESS.  S's <code>printer()</code> device driver produces crude character
based plots which can be contained within the ESS process buffer
itself.  To start using character graphics, issue the S command
<pre class="example">     printer(width=79)
</pre>
   <p><a name="index-printer_0028_0029-201"></a>(the <code>width=79</code> argument prevents Emacs line-wrapping at column
80 on an 80-column terminal.  Use a different value for a terminal with
a different number of columns.) Plotting commands do not generate
graphics immediately, but are stored until the <code>show()</code> command
is issued, which displays the current figure.

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.2 Using ESS with windowing devices</h4>

<p><a name="index-X-windows-202"></a>Of course, the ideal way to use graphics with ESS is to use a windowing
system.  Under X11, this requires that the DISPLAY environment
variable be appropriately set, which may not always be the case within
your Emacs process.  ESS provides a facility for setting the value of
DISPLAY before the ESS process is started if the variable
<code>ess-ask-about-display</code>
<a name="index-ess_002dask_002dabout_002ddisplay-203"></a>is non-<code>nil</code>.

</div>

<h4 class="subsection">13.3.3 Java Graphics Device</h4>

<p><a name="index-winjava-204"></a>
S+6.1 and newer on Windows contains a java library that supports graphics.  Send
the commands:

<pre class="example">     library(winjava)
     java.graph()
</pre>
   <p class="noindent">to start the graphics driver.  This allows you to use ESS for both
interaction and graphics within S-PLUS.  (Thanks to Tim Hesterberg for
this information.)

<h3 class="section">13.4 Imenu</h3>

<p>Imenu is an Emacs tool for providing mode-specific buffer indexes.  In
some of the ESS editing modes (currently SAS and S), support for Imenu
is provided.  For example, in S mode buffers, the menubar should display
an item called "Imenu-S".  Within this menubar you will then be offered
bookmarks to particular parts of your source file (such as the starting
point of each function definition).

   <p>Imenu works by searching your buffer for lines that match what ESS
thinks is the beginning of a suitable entry, e.g. the beginning of a
function definition.  To examine the regular expression that ESS uses,
check the value of <code>imenu-generic-expression</code>.  This value is set
by various ESS variables such as <code>ess-imenu-S-generic-expression</code>.

<h3 class="section">13.5 Toolbar</h3>

<p>The R and S editing modes have support for a toolbar.  This toolbar
provides icons to act as shortcuts for starting new S/R processes, or
for evaluating regions of your source buffers.  The toolbar should be
present if your emacs can display images.  See <a href="#Customization">Customization</a>, for ways
to change the toolbar.

</div>

<h3 class="section">13.6 TAGS</h3>

<p>The Emacs tags facility can be used to navigate around your files
containing definitions of S functions.  This facility is independent of
ESS usage, but is written here since ESS users may wish to take
advantage of TAGS facility.  Read more about emacs tags in an emacs
manual.

   <p>Etags, the program that generates the TAGS file, does not yet know the
syntax to recognise function definitions in S files.  Hence, you will
need to provide a regexp that matches your function definitions.  Here
is an example call (broken over two lines; type as one line) that should
be appropriate.

<pre class="example">     etags --language=none
     --regex='/\([^ \t]+\)[ \t]*&lt;-[ \t]*function/\1/' *.R
</pre>
   <p>This will find entries in your source file of the form:

<pre class="example">     some.name &lt;- function
</pre>
   <p>with the function name starting in column 0.  Windows users may need to
change the single quotes to double quotes.

   <p>R version 2.9.0 introduced a front-end script for finding R tags, which
calls the &lsquo;<samp><span class="samp">rtags()</span></samp>&rsquo; function).  By default, this script will
recursively search the directories for relevant tags in R/C/Rd files. 
To use this script from the command line, try the following to get
started:

<pre class="example">     R CMD rtags --help
</pre>

</div>

<h3 class="section">13.7 Rdired</h3>

<p>Ess-rdired provides a dired-like buffer for viewing, editing and
plotting objects in your current R session.  If you are used to using
the dired (directory editor) facility in Emacs, this mode gives you
similar functionality for R objects.

   <p>To get started, first make sure you can load ess-rdired.  Add the
following to your .emacs and then restart emacs.
<pre class="example">     (autoload 'ess-rdired "ess-rdired"
       "View *R* objects in a dired-like buffer." t)
</pre>
   <p>Start an R session with <kbd>M-x R</kbd> and then store a few
variables, such as:

<pre class="example">     s &lt;- sin(seq(from=0, to=8*pi, length=100))
     x &lt;- c(1, 4, 9)
     y &lt;- rnorm(20)
     z &lt;- TRUE
</pre>
   <p>Then use <kbd>M-x ess-rdired</kbd> to create a buffer listing the
objects in your current environment and display it in a new window:
<pre class="example">                 mode length
       s      numeric    100
       x      numeric      3
       y      numeric     20
       z      logical      1
</pre>
   <p>Type <kbd>C-h m</kbd> or <kbd>?</kbd> to get a list of the keybindings for this
mode.  For example, with your point on the line of a variable, `p' will
plot the object, `v' will view it, and `d' will mark the object for
deletion (`x' will actually perform the deletion).

     <ul>
<li>Commands like <code>ess-display-help-on-object</code> and list completion
cannot be used while the user is entering a multi-line command.  The
only real fix in this situation is to use another ESS process.

     <li>The <code>ess-eval-</code> commands can leave point in the ESS process
buffer in the wrong place when point is at the same position as the last
process output.  This proves difficult to fix, in general, as we need to
consider all <em>windows</em> with <code>window-point</code> at the right place.

     <li>It's possible to clear the modification flag (say, by saving the buffer)
with the edit buffer not having been loaded into S.

     <li>Backup files can sometimes be left behind, even when
<code>ess-keep-dump-files</code> is <code>nil</code>.

     <li>Passing an incomplete S expression to <code>ess-execute</code> causes ESS
to hang.

     <li>The function-based commands don't always work as expected on functions
whose body is not a parenthesized or compound expression, and don't even
recognize anonymous functions (i.e. functions not assigned to any
variable).

     <li>Multi-line commands could be handled better by the command history
mechanism.

     <li>Changes to the continutation prompt in R (e.g. 
<code>options(continue = "    ")</code>) are not automatically detected by ESS. 
Hence, for now, the best thing is not to change the continuation prompt. 
If you do change the continuation prompt, you will need to change
accordingly the value of <code>inferior-ess-secondary-prompt</code> in
<code>R-customize-alist</code>.

<p><a name="index-Bug-reports-206"></a><a name="index-ess_002dsubmit_002dbug_002dreport-207"></a>

   <p>Please send bug reports, suggestions etc. to
<a href="mailto:ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch">ESS-bugs@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>

   <p>The easiest way to do this is within Emacs by typing

   <p><kbd>M-x ess-submit-bug-report</kbd>

   <p>This also gives the maintainers valuable information about your
installation which may help us to identify or even fix the bug.

   <p>If Emacs reports an error, backtraces can help us debug the problem. 
Type "M-x set-variable RET debug-on-error RET t RET".  Then run the
command that causes the error and you should see a *Backtrace* buffer
containing debug information; send us that buffer.

   <p>Note that comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.

<h3 class="section">14.3 Mailing Lists</h3>

<p>There is a mailing list for discussions and announcements relating to
ESS.  Join the list by sending an e-mail with "subscribe ess-help" (or
"help") in the body to <a href="mailto:ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help-request@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>;
contributions to the list may be mailed to
<a href="mailto:ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch">ess-help@stat.math.ethz.ch</a>.  Rest assured, this is a fairly
low-volume mailing list.

   <p>The purposes of the mailing list include

     <ul>
<li> helping users of ESS to get along with it. 
<li> discussing aspects of using ESS on Emacs and XEmacs. 
<li> suggestions for improvements. 
<li> announcements of new releases of ESS. 
<li> posting small patches to ESS. 
</ul>

<h3 class="section">14.4 Help with emacs</h3>

<p>Emacs is a complex editor with many abilities that we do not have space
to describe here.  If you have problems with other features of emacs
(e.g. printing), there are several sources to consult, including the
emacs FAQs (try <kbd>M-x xemacs-www-faq</kbd> or <kbd>M-x view-emacs-FAQ</kbd>)
and EmacsWiki (<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org">http://www.emacswiki.org</a>).  Please consult them
before asking on the mailing list about issues that are not specific to
ESS.

<h2 class="appendix">Appendix A Customizing ESS</h2>

<p><a name="index-customization-208"></a>
ESS can be easily customized to your taste simply by including the
appropriate lines in your <samp><span class="file">.emacs</span></samp> file.  There are numerous
variables which affect the behavior of ESS in certain situations which
can be modified to your liking.  Keybindings may be set or changed to
your preferences, and for per-buffer customizations hooks are also
available.

   <p>Most of these variables can be viewed and set using the Custom facility
within Emacs.  Type <kbd>M-x customize-group RET ess RET</kbd> to see all the
ESS variables that can be customized.  Variables are grouped by subject
to make it easy to find related variables.

<a name="texinfo-footnotes-in-document"></a><h4>Footnotes</h4><p class="footnote"><small>[<a name="fn-1" href="#fnd-1">1</a>]</small> The variable <code>ess-change-sp-regexp</code> is a regular
expression matching commands which change the search list.  You will
need to modify this variable if you have defined custom commands (other
than <code>attach</code>, <code>detach</code>, <code>collection</code> or <code>library</code>)
which modify the search list.</p>
