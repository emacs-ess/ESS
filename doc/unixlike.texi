@comment THIS IS A REPLACEMENT FOR THE UNIX PORTION OF inst_tar.texi

For a @b{Unix or Unix-like installation}, please follow the next steps.
Retrieve the latest tgz file (@file{ess-VERSION.tgz}) from
@uref{http://ess.r-project.org/index.php?Section=download, ESS downloads area}.

@emph{GNU Emacs Simple Instructions:} for recent versions of Emacs (23.x or higher)
and ESS, the installation process is simple.

@enumerate
@item
Extract all the files from @file{ess-VERSION.tgz} into
the directory @file{PREFIX/site-lisp}
where @file{PREFIX} is appropriate for GNU Emacs on your system;
@file{PREFIX} will most likely be either
@file{/usr/share/emacs} or @file{/usr/local/share/emacs}
@comment which exists for packages like @ESS{}
(on Mac OS X, @file{PREFIX} will most likely be something like
@file{/Applications/Emacs.app/Contents/Resources}):
@example
GNU tar  % gtar zxf ess-VERSION.tgz -C PREFIX/site-lisp
Unix tar % gunzip < ess-VERSION.tgz | tar xf - -C PREFIX/site-lisp
@end example

@item
Then, add the line
@example
(require 'ess-site)
@end example
to @file{~/.emacs} and restart Emacs.

@item
If you see a buffer named @file{*ESS*}, then the simple instructions
were most likely successful.  If not, then read further.

@item
It could be that you have an older version of Emacs, some other problem
with your installation or you are not a sysadmin.  Whatever the case,
you may need to edit @file{ess-site.el} manually.  If that is the case,
then you should create a directory just for @ESS{} like @file{~/ess}
or @file{/usr/local/ess} and unpack @ESS{} there.  That way, your changes to
@file{ess-site.el} will not be lost if you update Emacs later.

@item
Replace the line above with
@example
(load "~/ess/ess-VERSION/lisp/ess-site")
@end example
in @file{~/.emacs} and restart Emacs.

@item
If you see a buffer named @file{*ESS*}, then the manual instructions
were most likely successful.  If not, then send a query to
@email{ess-help@@r-project.org}
explicitly describing your problem and your environment
including operating system, Emacs version, @ESS{} version, etc.
@end enumerate

@b{Due to XEmacs lacking some features that ESS requires, ESS support of XEmacs
ends with ESS 12.04-4.  This decision will be re-visited in the future as
XEmacs continues to sync with GNU Emacs.}

@emph{XEmacs Simple Instructions:} for recent versions of XEmacs (21.4.x or higher)
and ESS, the installation process is simple.

@enumerate
@item
Extract all the files from @file{ess-VERSION.tgz} when you are in
the current working directory of @file{/usr/local/LOCATION/xemacs/site-packages}
which exists for packages like @ESS{}
where @file{LOCATION} is @file{lib} for legacy installations and @file{share}
now (and for Mac OS X create a link to it from the directory
@file{/Applications/XEmacs.app/Contents/Resources/site-lisp}):
@example
%prompt gtar zxf ess-VERSION.tgz            # for GNU tar
%prompt gunzip < ess-VERSION.tgz | tar xf - # for Unix tar
@end example

@item
Then, add the line
@example
(require 'ess-site)
@end example
to @file{~/.xemacs/init.el} and restart XEmacs.

@b{(OPTIONAL) COMPILING E-LISP}:

Edit the default locations of @code{LISPDIR}, @code{INFODIR} and
@code{ETCDIR} in Section 1 of @file{Makeconf} (if you are
using XEmacs, then edit the XEmacs subsection in Section 1).

You can compile those files by:
@example
make all
@end example

When that completes successfully, install the compiled files:
@example
make install
@end example

@end enumerate
