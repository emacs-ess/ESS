Changes/New Features in 12.04-1:
@itemize @bullet
@item @iESS{[Stata]}: New interactive help invocation.
@item @iESS{[Stata]}: New custom variable @code{inferior-STA-start-file}.
@item @iESS{[Stata]}: @code{inferior-STA-program-name} is now ``stata''
and can be  customized.
@item @ESS{[Stata]} New sections in stata help files
Syntax(@kbd{s-S}), Remarks(@kbd{r}), Title(@kbd{t}).
@end itemize

Bug Fixes in 12.04-1:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: Better @code{ess-tracebug} error handling.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Corrected @code{ess-eldoc} help string filtering
and improved argument caching.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Indentation of non-block if/else/for/while lines fixed.
@item @code{M-x ess-version} should work better.
@item @ESS{}: Filename completion now again works inside strings.
@item @iESS{[Stata]}: Fixed prompt detection issue.
@item @ESS{[Rd]}: R is autostarted also from here, when needed.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 12.04:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{}: Reverting new behavior of 12.03, @kbd{TAB} in @code{ess-mode}
no longer completes by default.  If you want smart @kbd{TAB} completion
in R and S scripts, similarly to @iESS{} behavior, set the variable
@code{ess-tab-complete-in-script} to @code{t}. Also see
@code{ess-first-tab-never-complete} for how to customize where first
@kbd{TAB} is allowed to complete.
@item @ESS{}: completion is consistently bound to @kbd{M-TAB} (aka @kbd{M-C-i})
in both Emacs23 and Emacs24.
@item @ESS{}: The variable @code{ess-arg-function-offset-new-line}
introduced in @ESS{(12.03)} now accepts a list with the first element a
number to indicate that the offset should be computed from the indent of
the previous line. For example setting it to '(2) results in:

@verbatim
  a <- some.function(
    arg1,
    arg2)
@end verbatim


@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 12.03:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{} indentation: new offset variable @code{ess-arg-function-offset-new-line}
controlling for the indentation of lines immediately following open
'('. This is useful to shift backwards function arguments after a long
function call expression:

@verbatim
  a <- some.function(
         arg1,
         arg2)
@end verbatim


instead of the old

@verbatim
  a <- some.function(
                     arg1,
                     arg2)
@end verbatim

If '(' is not followed by new line the behavior is unchanged:

@verbatim
  a <- some.function(arg1,
                     arg2)
@end verbatim

This variable should be set as part of indentation style lists, or in
ess-mode hook.
@item @ESS{[R]}: @kbd{C-c .} sets (indentation) style.
@item @ESS{}: In ESS buffers @code{yank}(@kbd{C-y}) command accepts
 double argument @kbd{C-u C-u} to paste commands only. It deletes any
lines not beginning with a prompt, and then removes the prompt from
those lines that remain. Useful to paste code from emails,
documentation, inferior ESS buffers or transcript files.
@item Documentation: ESS user manual has been rearranged and
completed with several new chapters and sections to reflect newly added
features (``Completion'', ``Developing with ESS'', ``ESS tracebug'',
``ESS developer'', ``ESS ElDoc'', ``IDO Comppletion'' and ``Evaluating
Code'')
@item RefCard: Reference card was updated to include new features.
@item Eldoc: Eldoc was rewritten and is activated by default.
See @code{ess-use-eldoc}, @code{ess-eldoc-show-on-symbol},
@code{ess-eldoc-abbreviation-style} variables for how to change the default
behavior. @emph{Note:} @code{skeleton-pair-insert-maybe} prohibits eldoc
display, on @kbd{(} insertion.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Eldoc shows arguments of a generic function whenever found.
@item @ESS{}: @kbd{TAB} in @code{ess-mode} now indents and completes,
if there is nothing to indent. Set
@code{ess-first-tab-never-completes-p} to @code{t} to make @kbd{TAB}
never complete on first invocation. Completion mechanism is similar to
the completion in the @code{inferior-ess-mode} -- a filename expansion
is tried, if not found ESS completes the symbol by querying the
process.
@item @ESS{} for emacs version 24 or higher: ESS is  fully compatible with
the emacs 24 completion scheme, i.e. all the completion is done by
@code{completion-at-point}. Also in accordance with emacs conventions,
ESS doesn't bind @kbd{M-TAB} for emacs 24 or higher. @kbd{M-TAB} calls the
default @code{complete-symbol}.

@item @ESS{[R]}: Out of the box integration with @code{Auto
Completion} mode (http://cx4a.org/software/auto-complete/). Three AC
sources @code{ac-source-R-args}, @code{ac-source-R-objects} and
@code{ac-source-R} are provided. The last one combines the previous two
and makes them play nicely together. Set @code{ess-use-auto-complete} to
@code{t} to start using it.  Refer to documentation string of
@code{ac-use-auto-complete} for further information.
@item @ESS{[R]}: New unified and fast argument completion system,
comprised of @code{ess-funname.start}, @code{ess-function-arguments},
@code{ess-get-object-at-point}. Eldoc and auto-completion integration
are using this system.
@item @ESS{}: @code{ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS}(@kbd{C-c C-z}),
and @code{ess-switch-to-ESS}(@kbd{C-c C-y}): Automatically start the
process whenever needed.
@item @ESS{[R]}: @code{roxy} knows about previewing text version of the
documentation. Bound to @kbd{C-c C-e t}.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Solved the ``nil filename'' bug in roxygen support.
@item @ESS{[R]}: @code{ess-tracebug} is now part of @ESS{}:

New Features:

@itemize @minus
@item Source injection: Tracebug now can inject source references on the
fly during code evaluation, i.e. you don't have to source your file, but
just evaluate your code in normal fashion. Variable
@code{ess-tracebug-inject-source-p} controls this behavior - if t,
always inject source reference, if @code{'function}, inject only for
functions (this is the default), if @code{nil}, never inject.

During the source injection the value of `ess-eval-visibly-p' is
ignored.
@item Org-mode support: Visual debugger is now aware of the
temporary org source editing buffer (@kbd{C-c '}) and jumps through this
buffers if still alive, or in original org buffer otherwise.
@item New keys in watch mode: @kbd{?} and @kbd{d}
@item Two new hooks: ess-tracebug-enter-hook and ess-tracebug-exit-hook
@end itemize

@item @ESS{[R]}: New package @code{ess-developer} to evaluate @code{R}
code directly in the package environment and namespace. It can be
toggled on and off with @kbd{C-c d t}. When @code{ess-developer} is on
all ESS evaluation commands are redefined to evaluate code in
appropriate environments. Add package names to the list of your
development packages with @kbd{C-d a}, and remove with @kbd{C-d
r}. Source the current file with @kbd{C-d s}.Evaluation function which
depend on @code{`ess-eval-region'} ask for the package to source the
code into, @code{ess-eval-function} and alternatives search for the
function name in the development packages' environment and namespace and
insert the definition accordingly. See the documentation section
``Developing with ESS/ESS developer'' for more details.

@item @ESS{[R]} help system:

New Features:

@itemize @minus
@item @kbd{q} quits window instead of calling @code{ess-switch-to-end-of-ESS}.
This is consistent with emacs behavior help and other special buffers (@emph{breaking change}).
@item @kbd{k} kills window without asking for the name (pointed by Sam Steingold)
@item Help map inherits from @code{special-mode-map} as sugested by Sam Steingold.
@item Package index: new function @code{ess-display-index} bound to
@kbd{i} in help mode map.
@item Package vignettes: new function @code{ess-display-vignettes} bound to
@kbd{v} in help mode map.
@item Display help in HTML browser: new function @code{ess-display-help-in-browser} bound to
@kbd{w} in help mode map. It depends on @code{R}'s @code{browser}
option.
@item New custom variable @code{ess-help-pop-to-buffer}: if non-nil
@ESS{} help buffers are given focus on display. The default is
@code{t} (@emph{breaking change}).
@item New menu entries for the above functions.
@item Bogus help buffers are no longer generated by default, i.e.
buffers of the form ``No documentation for 'foo' in specified packages and libraries:
you could try '??foo' ''.  @code{ess-help-kill-bogus-buffers} now defaults to
@code{t}.  Beware, there may be instances where the default is unsatisfactory
such as debugging and/or during R development.  Thanks to Ross Boylan for
making the suggestion, Sam Steingold for reminding us of this variable and
Martin Maechler for the warning.
@end itemize
@item @ESS{} now uses @code{IDO} completing read functionality
for all the interactive requests. It uses ido completion
mechanism whenever available, and falls back on classical
completing-read otherwise. You can set @code{ess-use-ido} to nil if you
don't want the IDO completion. See the documentation string of
@code{ess-use-ido} for more information about @code{IDO} and @ESS{}
configuration.

@item @ESS{[S]}: ``@kbd{,}`` is bound to ess-smart-comma:
If comma is invoked at the process marker of an ESS inferior
buffer, request and execute a command from @code{`ess-handy-commands'}
list. If @code{ess-R-smart-operators} is t @code{`ess-smart-comma}
also inserts `` `` after comma.
@item @ESS{[S]}, notably @code{R}: Variable @code{`ess-handy-commands'}
stores an alist of useful commands which are called by @code{ess-smart-comma} in
the inferior buffer.

Currently containing:

@table @asis
@item change-directory
    @code{ess-change-directory}
@item help-index
          @code{ess-display-index}
@item help-object
         @code{ess-display-help-on-object}
@item vignettes
           @code{ess-display-vignettes}
@item objects[ls]
         @code{ess-execute-objects}
@item search
              @code{ess-execute-search}
@item set-width
           @code{ess-execute-screen-options}
@item install.packages
    @code{ess-install.packages}
@item library
             @code{ess-library}
@item setRepos
            @code{ess-setRepositories}
@item sos
                 @code{ess-sos}
@end table

Handy commands: @code{ess-library}, @code{ess-install.packages}, etc -
ask for item with completion and execute the correspond
command. @code{ess-sos} is a interface to @code{findFn} function in
package @code{sos}. If package @code{sos} is not found, ask user for
interactive install.

@item @ESS{}: New dynamic mode line indicator: Process status is automatically
reflected in all mode-lines of associated with the process
buffers. Particularly useful for displaying debug status of
@code{ess-tracebug} and developer status of @code{ess-developer} in all
associated buffers.

@item @ESS{}: New @code{ess-completing-read} mechanism: @ESS{} uses
@code{ido} completions whenever possible. Variable @code{ess-use-ido}
controls whether to use ido completion or not. Active by default.

@item @ESS{} now supports comint fields for output and input
detection. This feature is not used by default, but might be useful in
the future.

@item @ESS{[S]}: New custom variable @code{inferior-ess-S-prompt} to
customize prompt detection regular expression in the inferior ESS
buffers. You can customize this variable to enhance comint navigation
(@code{comint-previous-prompt} and @code{comint-next-prompt}) the
inferior buffers.

@item @ESS{[R]}: Internal @code{R} completion retrieval
(@code{ess-R-complete-object-name})  was rewritten and is faster now.

@item @ESS{} is using process plist to store process specific variables,
as opposed to buffer local variables as it was using before. The use of
buffer local variables to store process variables is discouraged.

@item @ESS{}: new functions to manipulate process plists:
@code{ess-process-get} and @code{ess-process-set}.

@item @ESS{}: Internal process waiting mechanism was completely rewritten. ESS
no more relies on prompt regular expressions for the prompt
detection. The only requirement on the primary process prompt is to end
in @code{> }. This could be overwritten by setting
@code{inferor-ess-primary-prompt}.

@item @ESS{[S]}, notably @code{R}: Saved command history:
 @var{ess-history-file} now accepts @code{t} (default), @code{nil}, or a
 file name. By setting it to @code{nil} no command line history is saved
 anymore.  @var{ess-history-directory} now allows to have the history
 all saved in one ``central'' file.
@item @ESS{[R]}: more Roxygen improvements.
@item @ESS{[R]}: @kbd{C-c .} to set (indentation) style.

@item @ESS{[R]}: Functions with non-standard names (for example 'aaa-bbb:cc') are
properly handled by font-lock and evaluation routines.
@item @ESS{[R]}:Several regexp bugs (described in etc/R-ESS-bugs.el) were
fixed in @code{ess-get-words-from-vector} and @code{ess-command}.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.14:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[BUGS/JAGS]}:  Batch BUGS is back!  For recent OpenBUGS
versions, 3.0.8+, a batch BUGS script is once again available,
but for Linux only.  Therefore, since it seems that BUGS and JAGS must
co-exist (rather than a transition from BUGS to JAGS), .bug files are
now in @ESS{[BUGS]} mode and .jag files are in @ESS{[JAGS]} mode.  @ESS{[BUGS]} now
works like @ESS{[JAGS]} rather than the original mode @ESS{[BUGS]} mode which
was difficult to maintain.  Although, @ESS{[BUGS]} appears to work,
there still may be some features missing as well as bugs.

@item @ESS{[R]}: New customizable variable @code{ess-swv-plug-into-AUCTeX-p}
Commands to Sweave current file and LaTeX the result are now available
to AUCTeX users, if this variable is set to @code{t}.

@item @ESS{[S]}: @kbd{C-c C-c}
(@code{ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step}) is now skipping over
comments as the other paragraph functions do.
It (and similar functions) should no longer wrongly find
@samp{function()} beginnings inside comments or strings.

@item @ESS{[SAS]}: improved by better support for GNU Emacs
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.13:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: On Windows, for R 2.12.0 and later, the Rterm executables
 (in subdirectories i386 / x64) now are found as well as for earlier R versions.
@item @ESS{[S+]}: on Windows, both 32- and 64-bit versions of S+ (``S-PLUS'')
 are found now and made available on the menu.
@item @ESS{[R]}: When prompting for a starting directory, the R version is
 (always?) correct now.
@item @ESS{[R]}: on non-Windows platforms, the @code{use-dialog-box}
 variable is no longer temporarily changed (to @code{nil} for R-x.y.z version
 functions and to @code{t} for @command{R} itself), but rather the user
 customization is obeyed.
@item @ESS{[R]}: more Roxygen improvements.
@item `Rd-preview-help' now generates preview buffers with navigation
facilities the same as regular help buffers.
@item @ESS{}: New functions and keys C-c [up] / [down]
 for evaluating the buffer ``from beginning till here''.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.12:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]} Font-locking:
 update of PROCs keywords (up to SAS 9.22); error/warnings.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Roxygen improvements: S4 classes;
 also optionally keep spaces when filling arguments
@item @ESS{[Rd]}: support new keywords:
 section-name \subsection plus a dozen ``new'' keywords; should match R
 2.12.x now.
@item @command{ess-display-help-on-object} (@kbd{C-c C-v})
 now @emph{caches} the list of topics, thus speeding up the improvement
 feature introduced in 5.9.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.11:
@itemize @bullet
@item Filename completion within buffers now adds only trailing
characters to complete the filename, rather than expanding to an
absolute file path.  This filename completion is bound to the TAB key.

@item @kbd{M-n P} in Sweave buffers now prompts for the command to run
instead of using @command{pdflatex} unconditionally, offering completion from
customizable collection @code{ess-swv-pdflatex-commands}, the first of
which is taken as default and that defaults to @command{texi2pdf}.
@item @kbd{M-RET} is now also bound in S language (R and S+) buffers
to @command{ess-use-this-dir}. It sends @code{setwd(..)} to the S process
to set the working directory to the one of the source file.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.10:
@itemize @bullet
@item @kbd{M-RET} in *S* buffers is now bound to
@code{ess-dirs}.  This function will set Emacs's current
directory to be the same as the *S* process.  This is useful if you use
@code{setwd()} within a *S* process.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.9:
@itemize @bullet
@item Toolbar:  The toolbar now has an icon for starting Splus.
@item Indentation: New documentation and code has been added to make it
easier to change how ESS indents code.  In particular, see
@code{ess-default-style}, @code{ess-own-style-list} and the documention
subsection ``Changing indentation styles''.
@item @command{ess-display-help-on-object} (@kbd{C-c C-v}) now offers
 completion candidates for help file aliases, in addition to object
 names.
@item Font locking: is now turned on
 even without @command{window-system} is @code{nil}, whenever
 @var{ess-font-lock-mode} is non-nil, i.e., by default.
@item @ESS{} script editing: ess-eval-deactivate-mark default is now t,
 as suggested by Leo Alekseyev and subsequent ``unanimous'' ESS-help
 discussion.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Editing support for ``#!'' (Rscript / littler) editing,
 thanks to Jeffrey Arnold.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Now finds all R versions, both 64-bit and 32-bit, on some
 64-bit Windows machines.  Please report back to ess-core success or failure
 on your 64-bit Windows machine.
@item ESS Manual now more visually pleasing; @uref{http://ess.r-project.org/Manual/ess.html}
@item @ESS{[R]}: Roxygen on XEmacs no longer font locks for now
 (as it required missing features and hence broke ESS startup, there).
@item @ESS{[R]}: Roxygen has a sub-menu on the [ESS] menu.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Function @command{ess-rutils-htmldocs} in
 @file{ess-rutils.el} offers an alternative to @code{help.start()} for
 navigating R documentation, using the @command{browse-url} Emacs
 function.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.8:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: New @file{ess-rutils.el} with utilities for listing, loading,
installing, and updating packages, as well as object manipulation
(listing, viewing, and deleting).  It also provides an alternative to
@code{RSiteSearch()} that uses the @command{browse-url} function, so
results can be viewed in an Emacs web browser.
@item @ESS{[R]}: much more extensive Roxygen interface, via ess-roxy.el
 from Henning Redestig. Ess-roxy supports filling of roxygen fields,
 generation and updating roxygen templates, completion of roxygen tags,
 basic navigation (marking and moving between entries), folding using
 hs-minor-mode and preview of the Rd file.
@item Emacs lisp files have got better names (partly, for now).
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.7:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: loading a source file (@kbd{C-c C-l}) now works in
 Windows, similarly to other platforms;
 (further; it had accidentally been broken in ESS 5.6 on all platforms)
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.6:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: help() calls have to differ from old default, with newer
 versions of R; currently via .help.ESS <- function(...) hack.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.4:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: The long overdue change
from @code{make-regexp} to @code{regexp-opt} for font-locking is
complete.  The new @code{regexp-opt} is now the default since
it is better than the old code in many ways (and especially more
maintainable).  However, there are certainly some special
cases missed (bug reports and patches welcome!).
Setting @code{ess-sas-run-regexp-opt} to @code{nil} will result
in the old code being used.
@item @ESS{[BUGS]} and @ESS{[JAGS]}: typing @code{=} now results in
 @code{<-}.
@item @ESS{[R]} function arguments ``show'' @code{(ess-r-args-show)} now
 uses the new @code{(tooltip-show-at-point)} contributed by Erik Iverson.
@item Toolbar icons now also work in (beta) Emacs 23.
@item @ESS{[S]}: New function @code{ess-change-directory} for setting both
 emacs' current directory and the directory of an *R* or *S* buffer.
@item @ESS{[S]} when transient-mark-mode is true, the mark is now kept,
 rather than deactivated, thanks to a patch from David Reitter.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.11:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: work around bug in Emacs 22.2 & 22.3 which fails to
 set case-fold fontification automatically.
@item Rd mode: support new keyword 'Rdversion'
@item @ESS{[R]}: now again works with Emacs 21.x
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.10:
@itemize @bullet
@item Fixed noweb-mode bug accidentally introduced into 5.3.9
@item In noweb-mode, e.g., Rnw-mode, electric ``<'' also inserts closing ``@@".
 Further, the code chunk boundaries are better kept up-to-date, such that
 code[R] <-> text[LaTeX] minor mode switching should happen more reliably.
@item In noweb-mode, fix a buglet in rare [Enter] or [Tab] behavior; further,
 by default disable the former `[[' .. `]]'  code-protection-when-filling
 behavior which has been found to be buggy.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.9:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: evince PDF viewer now supported as well; search order:
evince, Xpdf, Adobe/Acrobat Reader
@item @ESS{[R]}: added support for Roxygen, potentially to be extended.
@item @ESS{[S]} (and R): inferior (@code{*R*}) and transcript modes no longer
fontify language keywords (such as @code{for}, @code{in}, etc).
@item @iESS{[Stata]}: Customize the @code{ess-sta-delimiter-friendly} setting
to @code{t} to convert embedded semi-colons to newlines for Stata processing.
@item Sweave fix for embedded blanks in PDF reader and PDF files
@item Several fixes for Major Mode Convention violations in @code{ess-mode}
and @code{noweb-mode}.
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: @code{M-x comment-region} now available!
@item @ESS{[S]} The @code{ess-swv-*} commands (and keybindings) are now in
a submenu of the ``Noweb'' menu, when editing Sweave files.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.8:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: more separation from @ESS{[BUGS]} (as much as is currently planned);
now @kbd{C-c C-c} on an empty @file{.jmd} creates a template as it should;
symbolic links are created for CODA output so BOA is happy:
from @file{index.txt} to @file{.ind} and @file{chain#.txt} to @file{#.out}
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: buffer-local @code{ess-sas-submit-command} and
@code{ess-sas-submit-command-options} now recognized by @code{ess-sas-submit-region}
@item @ESS{[S]}: When trying to evaluate code in an S language buffer and
 there is no associated process, now start R automatically instead of
 signalling an error.  Also, restart R if there is an associated process
 which is not running.  However, do not start R just via the ``electric''
 @kbd{(} (@code{ess-r-args-auto-show}).
@item @ESS{[S]}: For (one-line) functions withOUT '@{ .. @}' bodys, the end
 of function is now correctly found more often.  This notably improves
 @kbd{C-c C-c} (@code{ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step}).
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: cleanup/re-organization of elisp code;
symbolic links for CODA output are now only created by the new
JAGS @code{system} command in version 1.0.3; specify whether
this command is available via @code{ess-jags-system}; if not
present, then no links are created so that the @code{*shell*}
buffer does not become unresponsive during the batch run
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.7:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{}: @code{ess-default-style} now *is* customizable, i.e.,
  changing its value in @file{~/.emacs} now does have the desired effect.
@item @ESS{}: @code{ess-font-lock-mode} is a new variable (default: t)
which controls whether font-locking is enabled in ESS buffers.
@item @ESS{[R]}: for XEmacs on Windows; another tweak to find R versions
@item @ESS{[SAS]}: font-locking updated for ODS and SAS Bayesian Procedures;
a more consistent handling of SAS options by
@code{ess-sas-submit-command-options} which is buffer-local; portable
snooze for MS Windows via customize-able @code{ess-sleep-for} (floats welcome);
Xpdf now supported as a PDF viewer
@item @ESS{[Rnw]}: now also works with ``emacs -nw'' and Emacs 22.
@item @ESS{[JAGS]}: now requires JAGS 1.0 (see the new ESS for JAGS help
section for more information): both need work; suggestions welcome
@item @ESS{[R]}: [TAB] completion now uses the R-internal completion
mechanism (for R >= 2.5.0).
@item @ESS{[R], [S]}: interpretation of ``_'' as assignment has
been removed in @code{ess-continued-statement-p} for R and S.
@item several internal code cleanups.
@item @ESS{[R]}: An experimental version of a new command @code{Rgui}
on MS Windows to send lines directly from emacs
to @code{Rgui} is available in file @code{lisp/essd-rgui.el}.
Preliminary documentation is in file @code{doc/rgui-doc.txt}.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.6:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{}: for XEmacs, using ``gnuclient'' (without a ``-q'') works for
 things like fix() after M-x gnuserv-start has been done.
@item @ESS{[R]}: M-x R-newest should now work in more situations on MS
 Windows, e.g., when R has been installed in a non-default "ProgramFiles"
 directory tree.  In these cases, there's no need to specify the name (and
 full path) of the R program anymore.
@item @ESS{[R]}: For XEmacs, startup (with new tooltip code) works again.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.5:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]} a new defun is available, @kbd{M-x R-newest}, which will start
the newest version of R that it can find on your system.
@item @ESS{[R]} add Sven Hartenstein's ``R function arguments tips''
 functionality, via new file @file{../lisp/essd-r-args.el}.
 Note that this includes an ``electric "("'' behavior inside @code{R-mode}
 which is @emph{active by default} and can be customized via
 @code{ess-r-args-electric-paren}; i.e., use @code{(setq
 ess-r-args-electric-paren nil)} to turn it off.  Further,
 @code{ess-r-args-show-as} allows to switch to the ``tooltip'' mode.
@item @ESS{}: functions @code{ess-get-pdf-viewer} and *-ps-viewer; built on new
 customizable variables @code{ess-pdf-viewer-pref} and
 @code{ess-ps-viewer-pref}; currently used in @code{ess-swv-PDF} and
 @code{*-PS}.
@item @ESS{[R]} Improved @code{ess-swv-PDF} to run pdf viewer only if
 pdflatex was ok
@item @ESS{[R]} Improved @code{ess-swv-weave} to start R automatically if
 none is running.
@item @ESS{}: Do no longer ask @emph{which} ESS process to use if there
 is only one.

Changes/New Features in 5.3.4:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]} now better work with options(error=recover); and the
new default of CHM help files on windows.
@item @ESS{[R]} some more cleanup in the ``sweave'' functions
@item miscellaneous fixes
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.3:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[S]} fix buglet (5.3.2 only) which left command prompt in
``execute buffer'' and hence help files.
@item new customizable variable @code{ess-display-buffer-reuse-frames}
set to true (which changes default behavior) such that execution or
help *frames* are reused.
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.2:
@itemize @bullet
@item Classic BUGS now supported by @code{(require 'essd-bugs)} with @ESS{[BUGS]}
      and JAGS by @code{(require 'essd-jags)} with @ESS{[JAGS]}.  But, only one
      of them can be used at a time since they don't play nice together.  Also,
      @kbd{C-c C-c} is now bound to the function @code{ess-bugs-next-action}
      (@kbd{F12} has been retired).  And finally, note that @file{essl-bug.el}
      is deprecated and the replacement is @file{essl-bugs.el}.
@item @ESS{[R]} Improved some of the ``Sweave-make''
 functions (yet scarcely documented) in @file{ess-swv.el}.
@item @ESS{[S]} No longer mess with .Last.value (nor in other ``languages'').
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.1:
@itemize @bullet
@item See the docs for 2 ways to install @ESS{} for XEmacs
      @enumerate
      @item by uncommenting the XEmacs part of
            Section 1 of @file{Makeconf} and performing @code{make install}
      @item by unpacking either
            @file{ess-5.3.1.tgz} or @file{ess-5.3.1.zip} into
            @file{PREFIX/lib/xemacs/site-packages} on unix or
            @file{PREFIX\XEmacs\site-packages} on windows
      @end enumerate
@item @ESS{[R]}: fixed bugs so that Rterm.exe can be found by XEmacs
@item @ESS{[S]}: @kbd{ess-toggle-S-assign-key} is slightly changed; in
 particular, the default @code{ess-assign-key} is now @kbd{C-x =}.
@item @ESS{[R]}: @kbd{M-x R-site-search} is a new (slightly experimental)
 utility similar to R's @code{RSiteSearch(..)} but with the advantage of
 using Emacs' preferred browser, see @code{browse-url-browser-function}
@end itemize

Changes/New Features in 5.3.0:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[BUGS]}: sanely re-format statistical output, @file{.bog},
from scientific notation to numbers rounded with 4 decimal places
with @kbd{M-x ess-bugs-sci-round-to-4-dp}.
@item The keys for navigating among section headings in help buffers
worked, but only for one language per session; they should now work for
multiple languages.  (They were also broken on Windows machines.)
@item @ESS{[S]} long standing buglets in the internal logic for loading
lisp code on Windows.  Particularly fixed behavior in help mode with S-plus
GUI.
@item New variable, @code{ess-use-inferior-program-name-in-buffer-name},
which enables using the executable name instead of the dialect name for
R. Feature request.
@item @ESS{[S]} @kbd{ess-execute-screen-options}
now also works correctly when there is more than one window *side-by-side*
in the same frame and runs in the correct buffer also when there is more
than one S buffer.
@item @iESS{[S]} new functions @code{ess-eval-paragraph-and-step} and
 @code{ess-eval-function-or-paragraph-and-step} are bound to keys
 @kbd{C-c C-p} and @kbd{C-c C-c} respectively and to the menu in
 @ESS{}-mode; also bound in the help mode (for evaluating examples).
@item @ESS{[S]} new function @code{ess-toggle-S-assign-key} allows to
assign the `` <- '' insertion to an arbitrary key.
