Changes and New Features in development version:
@itemize @bullet

@item @ESS{[R]}: Fontification of roxygen @code{@@param} keywords now
supports comma-separated parameters.

@item @ESS{[R]}: Function-like keywords such as @code{if ()} or
@code{stop()} are no longer fontified as keyword if not followed by an
opening parenthesis. The same holds for search path modifiers like
@code{library()} or @code{require()}. This feature is only available in
Emacs >= 25.

@item @ESS{[R]}: We have improved fontification of keywords so they
better reflect the semantics of the R language. @code{ess-R-keywords}
now only contains words reserved by the R parser.
@code{ess-R-control-flow-keywords} contains words of base functions that
cause non-contiguous control flow, such as @code{return()} and
@code{stop()}. It includes the following variables that were previously
not fontified: @code{on.exit()}, @code{tryCatch()},
@code{withRestarts()}, @code{invokeRestart()}, @code{recover()} and
@code{browser()}

Finally, @code{ess-R-signal-keywords} contains functions part of the
condition system that only potentially impact control flow:
@code{message()}, @code{warning()} (moved from @code{ess-R-keywords}),
@code{signalCondition()} and @code{withCallingHandlers()}. These
keywords inherit from @code{ess-modifiers-face} (the face used for
@code{library()} etc).

@item ESS modes now inherit from @code{prog-mode}.

@item @ESS{[R]}: The package development minor mode now only activates
within editing buffers by default, i.e. ones that inherit from
@code{prog-mode} or @code{text-mode}. If you want to restore the old
behaviour and activate the package mode in all buffers (that have a
@code{default-directory} that is part of a package path), set
@code{ess-r-package-auto-activate} to @code{t}.

@item ESS now provides support for flymake in R buffers for Emacs 26 and newer.
Users need to install the @code{lintr} package (available on CRAN) to
use it. Customizable options include @code{ess-use-flymake},
@code{ess-r-flymake-linters}, and @code{ess-r-flymake-lintr-cache}.

@item Improved customization for faces.
ESS now provides custom faces for (nearly) all faces used and places
face customization options into their own group. Users can customize
these options using @kbd{M-x customize-group RET ess-faces}.

@item @ESS{[R]}: Gained support for xref in Emacs 25+.
@xref{Xref,,, emacs, The Gnu Emacs Reference Manual}

@item @ESS{[R]}: Changing the working directory is now always reflected
in the process buffer.

@item @ESS{[R]}: The startup screen has been cleaned up and displays
the startup directory with an explicit @code{setwd()}.

@item ESS now displays the language dialect in the mode-line
So, for example, R buffers will now show ESS[R] rather than ESS[S].

@item The ESS manual has been updated and revised.

@item @ESS{[R]}: @code{Makevars} files are now automatically opened
with @code{makefile-mode}.

@item New varaible @code{ess-write-to-dribble}.
This allows users to disable the dribble (@code{*ESS*}) buffer if they wish.

@item ESS now respects Emacs conventions for keybindings.
This means that The @code{C-c [letter]} bindings have been
removed. This affects @code{C-c h}, which was bound to
@code{ess-eval-line-and-step-invisibly} in @code{sas-mode-local-map};
@code{C-c f}, which was bound to @code{ess-insert-function-outline} in
@code{ess-add-MM-keys}; and @code{C-c h}, which was bound to
@code{ess-handy-commands} in @code{Rd-mode-map},
@code{ess-noweb-minor-mode-map}, and @code{ess-help-mode-map}


@item prettify-symbols-mode no longer breaks indentation
This is accomplished by having the pretty symbols occupy the same
number of characters as their non-pretty cousins.  You may customize
the new variable @code{ess-r-prettify-symbols} to control this
behavior.

@item Variable @code{ess-s-versions-list} is obsolete and ignored.
Use @code{ess-s-versions} instead.  You may pass arguments by starting the inferior process with the universal argument.

@item All of the @code{*-program-name} variables have been renamed to @code{*-program}.
Users who previously customized e.g. @code{inferior-ess-R-program-name}
will need to update their customization to
@code{inferior-ess-R-program}. These variables are treated as risky
variables.

@item Customization of ess-smart-S-assign-key has been reworked.
Use @code{(setq ess-smart-S-assign-key nil)} to disable smart
assignment at any time instead of @code{(ess-toggle-underscore nil)}.
To use another key, you should set the value of
@code{ess-smart-S-assign-key} before ESS is loaded. The following
functions have been made obsolete. You should customize
ess-smart-S-assign-key instead: ess-toggle-S-assign,
ess-toggle-S-assign-key, ess--unset-smart-S-assign-key,
ess--activate-smart-S-assign-key, ess-disable-smart-S-assign

Changes and New Features in 17.11:
@itemize @bullet

@item The ESS initialisation process has been streamlined. You can now
load the R and Stata modes independently from the rest of ESS. Just put
@code{(require 'ess-r-mode)} or @code{(require 'ess-stata-mode)} in your
init file. This is for experienced Emacs users as this requires setting
up autoloads for @code{.R} files manually. We will keep maintaining
@code{ess-site} for easy loading of all ESS features.

@item Reloading and quitting the process is now more robust. If no
process is attached, ESS now switches automatically to one (prompting
you for selection if there are several running). Reloading and quitting
will now work during a debug session or when R is prompting for input
(for instance after a crash). Finally, the window configuration is saved
and restored after reloading to prevent the buffer of the new process
from capturing the cursor.

@item @ESS{[R]}: New command @code{ess-r-package-use-dir}. It sets the
working directory of the current process to the current package directory.

@item @ESS{[R]} Lookup for references in inferior buffers has been
improved. New variable @code{ess-r-package-source-roots} contains
package sub-directories which are searched recursively during the file
lookup point. Directories in @code{ess-tracebug-search-path} are now
also searched recursively.

@item @ESS{[R]} Namespaced evaluation is now automatically enabled only
in the @code{R/} directory. This way ESS will not attempt to update
function definitions from a package if you are working from e.g. a test
file.

@end itemize


Changes and New Features in 16.10:
@itemize @bullet

@item @ESS{[R]}: Syntax highlighting is now more consistent. Backquoted
names are not fontified as strings (since they really are identifiers).
Furthermore they are now correctly recognised when they are function
definitions or function calls.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Backquoted names and @code{%op%} operators are
recognised as sexp. This is useful for code navigation, e.g. with
@kbd{C-M-f} and @kbd{C-M-b}.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Integration of outline mode with roxygen examples fields.
You can use outline mode's code folding commands to fold the examples
field. This is especially nice to use with well documented packages with
long examples set. Set @code{ess-roxy-fold-examples} to non-nil to
automatically fold the examples field when you open a buffer.
@item @ESS{[R]}: New experimental feature: syntax highlighting in
roxygen examples fields. This is turned off by default. Set
@code{ess-roxy-fontify-examples} to non-nil to try it out.
@item @ESS{[R]}: New package development command @code{ess-r-devtools-ask}
bound to @kbd{C-c C-w C-a}. It asks with completion for any devtools
command that takes @code{pkg} as argument.
@item @ESS{[R]}: New command @kbd{C-c C-e C-r} to reload the inferior process. 
Currently only implemented for R. The R method runs @code{inferior-ess-r-reload-hook}
on reloading.
@item @ESS{[R]}: @code{ess-r-package-mode} is now activated in non-file buffers as well.
@end itemize

Bug fixes in 16.10:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: Fix broken (un)flagging for debugging inside packages
@item @ESS{[R]}: Fixes (and improvements) in Package development
@item @ESS{[R]}: Completion no longer produces @code{...=} inside @code{list(  )}.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Better debugging and tracing in packages.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Better detection of symbols at point.
@item @ESS{[R]}: No more spurious warnings on deletion of temporary files.
@item @ESS{[julia]}: help and completion work (better)
@item @ESS{[julia]}: available via @code{ess-remote}
@end itemize

Changes and New Features in 16.04:
@itemize @bullet

@item @ESS{[R]}: @code{developer} functionality has been refactored.
The new user interface consists of a single command
@code{ess-r-set-evaluation-env} bound by default to @kbd{C-c C-t
C-s}. Once an evaluation environment has been set with, all subsequent
ESS evaluation will source the code into that environment. By default,
for file within R packages the evaluation environment is set to the
package environment. Set @code{ess-r-package-auto-set-evaluation-env} to
@code{nil} to disable this.
@item @ESS{[R]}: New @code{ess-r-package-mode}
This development mode provides features to make package development
easier. Currently, most of the commands are based on the @code{devtools}
packages and are accessible with @kbd{C-c C-w} prefix. See the
documentation of @code{ess-r-package-mode} function for all available
commands. With @kbd{C-u} prefix each command asks for extra arguments to
the underlying devtools function. This mode is automatically enabled in
all files within R packages and is indicated with @code{[pkg:NAME]} in
the mode-line.
@item @ESS{[R]}: Help lookup has been improved.
It is now possible to get help for namespaced objects such as
pkg::foobar. Furthermore, ESS recognizes more reliably when you change
@code{options('html_type')}.
@item @ESS{[R]}: New specialized breakpoints for debugging magrittr pipes
@item @ESS{}: ESS now implements a simple message passing interface
to communicate between ESS and inferior process.
@end itemize

Bug fixes in 16.04:
@itemize @bullet
@item @ESS{[R]}: Roxygen blocks with backtics are now correctly filled
@item @ESS{[R]}: Don't skip breakpoints in magrittr's @code{debug_pipe}
@item @ESS{[R]}: Error highlighting now understands `testthat` type errors
@item @ESS{[Julia]}: Added getwd and setwd generic commands
@end itemize
