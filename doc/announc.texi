The ESS Developers proudly announce the release of ESS
@include ../VERSION

@c --------------------------------------------------------------------
Emacs Speaks Statistics (ESS) provides an intelligent, consistent
interface between the user and the software.  ESS interfaces with
R/S-PLUS, SAS, BUGS/JAGS, Stata and other statistical analysis
packages under the UNIX, GNU Linux, Microsoft Windows, macOS and
other operating systems.  ESS is a package for the GNU Emacs text editor
whose features ESS uses to streamline the creation
and use of statistical software.  ESS knows the syntax and grammar of
statistical analysis packages and provides consistent display and
editing features based on that knowledge.  ESS assists in interactive
and batch execution of statements written in these statistical
analysis languages.

ESS is freely available under the GNU General Public License (GPL).
Please read the file COPYING which comes with the distribution, for
more information about the license. For more detailed information,
please read the README files that come with ESS.
@c And to clear up any possible confusion; the name is ESS, NOT ESS-mode.
@c Thank you :-).
