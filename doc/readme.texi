This is the README file for the distribution of ESS version
@include ../VERSION

ESS is a GNU Emacs package for interactive statistical
programming and data analysis.  Languages supported: the S family (S,
S-PLUS and R), SAS, BUGS/JAGS and Stata.  ESS grew out of the
desire for bug fixes and extensions to S-mode and SAS-mode as well as a
consistent union of their features in one package.

Installation instructions are provided in sections for both Unix and
Windows; see below.

The current development team is led by Martin Maechler since August
2004. Former project leader A.J. (Tony) Rossini
(@email{rossini@@blindglobe.net}) did the initial port to XEmacs and has
been the primary coder.  Martin Maechler
(@email{maechler@@stat.math.ethz.ch}) and Kurt Hornik
(@email{Kurt.Hornik@@R-project.org}) have assisted with the S family and
XLispStat.  Stephen Eglen (@email{stephen@@gnu.org}) has worked mostly
on R support.  Richard M. Heiberger (@email{rmh@@temple.edu}) has
assisted with S/S-PLUS development for Windows.  Richard and Rodney
A. Sparapani (@email{rsparapa@@mcw.edu}) have done much of the work
improving SAS batch and interactive support.  Rodney has also
extended ESS to support BUGS/JAGS and has an interest in improving
Stata support.

We are grateful to the previous developers of S-mode (Doug Bates, Ed Kademan,
Frank Ritter, David M. Smith), SAS-mode (Tom Cook) and Stata-mode (Thomas
Lumley).
@c The name is ESS.  Not ESS-mode.
