S-mode version 3.4
------------------

Please note: the filenames mentioned below may be compressed at this
site (such files will have an extra extension of `.Z'). Such files
need to be transferred in ftp BINARY mode and uncompressed (e.g. with
the Unix "uncompress" utility) at your site. Tar files (ending in
`.tar') must also be transferred in BINARY mode.

This is version 3.4 of the S-mode distribution. You should get
S-mode3.4.tar, which contains the following files:

README			This file
CHANGES			Changes from version 2.1
S.el (version 3.4)	Emacs-lisp code for S-mode
S-tek.el (version 1.0)	Graphics engine for Tek terminals
comint.el		The comint package
comint-extra.el		Additions to the comint package
comint-isearch.el       Incremental search for comint command history
S-mode.texinfo (v 1.20)	Documentation for S-mode

(You can extract these files with the Unix command "tar xvf S-mode3.4.tar")


INSTALLING THE DOCUMENTATION
----------------------------

Within Emacs, type "C-h i m Texinfo RET" for information on
installing and reading Texinfo files. If you can't do this then you
can get one of the following files from attunga.stats.adelaide.edu.au
in directory pub/S-mode by anonymous ftp:

S-mode.info		For installing in your info tree
S-mode.ps		Postscript version of the documentation
S-mode.dvi		DVI version of the documentation

INSTALLING S-MODE
-----------------

Create a directory (say, `~/elisp') to place the Emacs-Lisp files.
Copy `S.el', `comint.el' and `comint-extra.el' to that directory, and
add the lines

     (setq load-path (cons (expand-file-name "~/elisp") load-path))
     (autoload 'S "S" "Run an inferior S process" t)
     (autoload 's-mode "S" "Mode for editing S source" t)

to your `.emacs' file. You can byte-compile the `.el' files if you
wish. See the documentation and the `S.el' file for more details ---
in particular, if you use a non-standard prompt or if the command to
run S is not `Splus' then you have more to do.

CHANGES FROM VERSION 2.1
------------------------

See the file CHANGES in the S-mode distribution.

BUG REPORTS, ETC
----------------

Until the end of August 1992, please report bugs to me at
dsmith@stats.adelaide.edu.au. After this date, mail to that address
will not be answered for some time; please contact Frank Ritter
(Frank_Ritter@SHAMO.SOAR.CS.CMU.EDU) or any of the other authors then
(please CC: to me as well though -- you never know, I might just
answer!) Comments, suggestions, words of praise and large cash
donations are also more than welcome.
