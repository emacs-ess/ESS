* GENERAL
** TODO [#A] populate ess-autoload.el and call it from ess-site.el    :13_09:
   This will ensure that very quick start both for (require "ess-start") and
   MELPA users.
** TODO [#B] build ert based test suit                                :13_09:
** TODO split ess-mode into specialized derived modes
** TODO remote M-x ess-sas-interactive via shell with ssh  
   sets ess-process-name-list to (("shell"))
   This prevents iESS[SAS] evaluation since a value of (("SAS")) would be
   necessary for that.

** TODO make ess-selection-mode-map or just use ess-debug-mode-map
   When recover mode is on, it would be very convenient to exit it with M-Q.

   Try to solve with gettext R's functionality. Partially solved (for most
   important cases) by relaxing regular expressions.
