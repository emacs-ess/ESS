** TODO Help focus does not honor focus-follows-mouse/mouse-autoselect-window 
If you have focus-follows-mouse and mouse-autoselect-window set to t,
then ask for help in an *R* buffer, i.e.
> ?setwd

The help buffer steals focus permanently instead of surrendering it
to mouse movement; you need to physically click in the *R*
buffer to restore the focus following the mouse.  C-c C-d C-d
behaves similarly.  Ideally, we should respect the user's settings 
of focus-follows-mouse/mouse-autoselect-window in this common 
help/*R* buffer arrangement.
** TODO Make an option to remember eval-and-go code in comint history
